  abstract={By creating a sophisticated virtual assistant (VA), this study investigates how generative AI might revolutionise human-machine interaction (HMI). Our suggested solution overcomes conventional constraints by utilising cutting-edge generative models, which allow the VA to produce contextually relevant responses and adjust to a variety of user inputs. The project’s goals include increasing user engagement, broadening the Virtual Assistant’s scope of work, and maximising the effectiveness of human-machine interactions overall. The paper explores the technical aspects of putting generative AI into practice, emphasising its real-time understanding of user intent, context, and sentiment. We tackle issues including potential biases, ethical concerns, and the requirement for ongoing learning to guarantee the responsible and efficient use of generative AI in virtual assistant applications. By means of this study, we hope to add to the current conversation on the direction of HMI by illuminating the revolutionary potential of Generative AI in producing more perceptive, flexible, and human-like virtual assistants.},

  abstract={The brain is one of the most complicated human organs, and diseases associated with the brain are still hard to diagnose, treat and manage. The development of devices such as Artificial Intelligence technology has made wonders in understanding the causes, diagnosing, and offering treatment to brain abnormalities. In neurology, the use of AI to process medical data to understand, classify, and prognose diseases can avail new details about disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, stroke, and cancerous lesions of the brain. The review analyses the role of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of human brain diseases with an emphasis on how it is currently used, what benefits it may bring and what drawbacks are connected with this. We emphasize new informational technologies and outline strategies for the incorporation of AI among other technologies in the management of patients in neurological disorders, as well as in the development of the field as a whole. Artificial Intelligence (AI) application in health-related activities has changed how brain diseases of man are diagnosed, treated and managed. A detailed study here seeks to examine how recent relevant developments especially AI methods including ML, DL and NLP have been beneficial in understanding more neurological disorders. It notes how holistically, AI is applicable in diseases involving the brain, such as Alzheimer's stroke, and brain tumors.},

  pages={1412-1416},
  abstract={Vehicle trajectory prediction, as one of the core technologies in intelligent transportation and autonomous driving, plays a significant role in reducing collision risks. However, complex spatiotemporal dependencies and dynamic interactions remain challenging technical issues that require urgent resolution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a GAN-based multi-module fusion prediction model. By integrating multiple architectures-including a graph attention network, a Transformer encoder, and a temporal convolutional network-the model simultaneously optimizes spatial interactions, temporal dependencies, and trajectory feature modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods such as CV, CS-LSTM, and TCN-LSTM, the proposed model significantly improves prediction accuracy by reducing the average displacement error and final displacement error by 24.38% and 14.46%, respectively, thereby fully validating its effectiveness in complex traffic scenarios.},

  abstract={In order to produce high-quality applications while decreasing human labor and speeding up application development, automatic software testing is a crucial development methodology. This paper presents a novel framework that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve automated software testing through intelligent solutions. Through machine learning techniques that perform test case selection and bug prediction with programming code base change monitoring, the framework achieves its optimization. Testing processes benefit from automated learning features that boost testing performance in real-time and artificial intelligence-based models that enhance error detection capabilities. When findings from contemporary methodologies surpass those from traditional testing methods, there are improvements in test coverage as well as fault detection capabilities and overall efficiency. This framework proposes a potential approach to the testing of AI and machine learning that takes into account adaption constraints as well as test scalability issues and automation dependability.},

  pages={235-239},
  abstract={Mining anomalies and special events from massive network flows based on machine learning and deep learning is a promising approach for network management. However, it is difficult to build labeled network flow data sets for training machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) powered generative adversarial network (GAN) model named NF-GAN for network flow generation. The generator of NF-GAN is designed as a stochastic policy model to generate labeled network flow data. In terms of the discriminator, a check reward is integrated into the network reward to capture the correlations among attributes. Experiment results demonstrate that the majority of the generated flows conform to the strict network protocols of the standard OSI stack, and the success rate of network flows generation achieves 99.96%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time of applying RL powered GAN on network flow generation tasks.},

  abstract={This exploratory analysis investigates the integration of ChatGPT in self-directed learning (SDL). Specifically, this study examines YouTube content creators’ language-learning experiences and the role of ChatGPT in their SDL, building upon Song and Hill's conceptual model of SDL in online contexts. Thematic analysis of interviews with 19 YouTubers and relevant video contents reveals distinct constructs of ChatGPT-integrated SDL, suggesting a reconceptualization and refinement of the SDL framework in the consideration of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This framework emphasizes critical aspects of utilizing ChatGPT as an SDL tool on two distinct levels: 1) the interactive relationships and interplay between learners’ personal traits and their ongoing learning processes (local) and 2) the evolving nature of SDL in the rapidly advancing landscape of generative AI, with socio-political-cultural foundations of AI constantly shaping the learning environment where SDL occurs (global). The study highlights the potential of ChatGPT as a tool for promoting self-directed language learning (SDLL) and provides implications for the development of learning technologies and research on AI-facilitated SDL.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) ushers in a new era of possibilities and efficiencies in how businesses can ideate, conceptualize, strategize, and develop marketing innovations. This chapter discusses how the readers can use AI and, specifically, generative AI to fuel the ideation processes. The results of specific ideation studies have shown AI&#x2010;generated ideas to be viable and on par with human&#x2010;generated ones. AI hallucinations can lead to unexpected, novel, and completely new ideas that break conventional thinking patterns. A common and useful scenario for using generative AI involves idea generation during a creative brainstorming process. A good starting point for combining human creativity with AI capabilities is to establish a prompt for both parties. The Creative Assistant tool augments human creativity, symbolizing the fusion of human ingenuity with AI capabilities. It empowers creators to continually enhance their presence on TikTok through perpetual ideation sessions.</p>},

  abstract={The rapid evolution of technology has transformed industries worldwide, revealing critical gaps in traditional educational approaches, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) including in the field of product development. Traditional academic frameworks often struggle to keep pace with industry demands, leaving some students underprepared for real-world challenges. This study identifies three core issues within STEM education: how to update curricula that lag technological advancements, limited opportunities for practical, hands-on application of skills, and constrained academic timeframes that limit the depth of transformative learning experiences.To address these issues, this research explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Agile methodologies to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice in the field of product development. By examining two case studies - the development of an AI-driven media analysis tool for the United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC) and AI-focused capstone projects within a Management and Systems graduate program. We show how applying Generative AI and Agile technologies can enhance curriculum relevance, expand real-world skill development opportunities, and optimize learning within semester-based time constraints. AI enables adaptive, personalized learning and automates routine tasks, while Agile’s iterative approach fosters engagement and adaptability in real-world problem-solving scenarios. AI is also a productive basis for product development in the integrative experience of a capstone. This research shows how combining AI and Agile provides an integrated framework for modernizing educational practices, equipping students with essential industry-relevant skills for a technology-driven workforce.},

  abstract={With the advancement of big data, the scope and potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have acquired major momentum. Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) is one of the most emergent fields of study in the current era of digitalization. Many examples have proven the effectiveness of Machine- and Deep Learning methods. In industrial production, however, limitations are still present that hinder application online and in a series that goes beyond isolated use cases. One crucial issue is data precondition, i.e., data quality, consistency, and labeling. As DCAI addresses these issues, developments in this field have caught the attention of various experts. In summary, DCAI continues to be an exciting and promising field of study that enhances AI applicability. Several research works have been conducted in DCAI, but unfortunately, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize and highlight the results. This gap in knowledge inspired our work, that aims to answer well-structured research questions. The focus of this paper is to clarify the terminology used in DCAI while also distinguishing it from other AI-related problems. This helps to analyze the current standards and problems associated with DCAI. This paper summarizes current use cases of DCAI and their impact on industries. Through this detailed description, readers can understand the potential and benefits of using DCAI in different business sectors. The analysis of the latest methods employed by DCAI to achieve enhanced AI performance and outcomes provides valuable insights for professionals and organizations that strive to incorporate AI into their business.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposed an adaptive gAI-based multi-agent framework that enables collaboration between human actors and multiple AI agents, i.e. ExplainAgent, AuditAgent, RobustAgent and AutoAgent tailored to mirror and provide specialised support for the various aspects of trustworthy AI. Each of the agents will be clearly defined and specialised through the customisation of multiple modules encompassing 1) Communication and Cooperation, 2) Ensure Trust and 3) Execute and Evaluate Decisions. The framework focuses on improving explainability, fairness, and robustness while fostering human-AI collaboration with the aim of advancing trustworthy AI methods, tools and best practices leveraging AI and related technologies.},

  abstract={A camouflage pattern is a texture pattern that contains various colors and localized shapes to be blended with landscapes or objects. Although most of camouflage patterns are generally created by randomly combining colors and various local shapes based on human subjectivity, it can be difficult to generate an appropriate camouflage pattern according to a specific background image. In this paper, we propose a method that can emergently generate complex camouflage patterns by using an Ant Painting algorithm. In the proposed method, after some features of an input image are extracted, artificial ants draws a camouflage according to the features. We demonstrate that, by interaction among ants, the proposed method can generate camouflage patterns which are more complex but blends better with the background image than random generation.},

  abstract={The remarkable performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. This study intends to outline the development trends and research focus in the AI-Alzheimer field. The VOSviewer and bibliometrix R software package are employed for bibliometrics and visualization analysis of literature obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database. There are 5,991 affiliations from 104 countries/regions that published 5,675 articles in this field by 2023. Results demonstrate that the number of AIAlzheimer-related publications has experienced slow progress for over twenty years before entering a period of exponential growth in 2016. The United States and China, contributing over 54% of the publications, stand out as leaders in technological innovation and international cooperation. The clustering analysis of keywords indicates that the major research domains are the utilization of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) classification, early diagnosis of disease, and drug discovery. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), transfer learning, and Transformers are the emerging AI algorithms applied in the field of Alzheimer’s research, which also represent promising directions for future investigation. The findings provide a comprehensive summary of the AI-Alzheimer field and identify research frontiers, offering valuable references for scholars.},

  title={ChatGPT in Artificial Intelligence-Empowered E-Learning for Cultural Heritage: The case of Lyrics and Poems}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, in the domain of cultural heritage Artificial Intelligence-based e-learning, with a specific focus on the analysis and interpretation of lyrics and poems. Cultural heritage preservation and education have increasingly turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance learning experiences and promote the understanding and appreciation of diverse artistic expressions. We have conducted an initial empirical study on how ChatGPT can assist learners in analysing and interpreting poetic and lyrics works, offering insights into the historical, cultural, and literary significance embedded within the verses. Our findings highlight ChatGPT's significant potential but also major weaknesses with respect to poetry and lyrics. ChatGPT was found particularly good in the field of interpreting poetic content. Additionally, ChatGPT showed a very good performance in analogy identification, demonstrating a broad knowledge base encompassing various form of poetry, from Ancient Greek works to ecclesiastic hymns and modern compositions. However, opportunities for enhancement are evident in translation and historical context provision. Finally, ChatGPT's weakest aspect was its factual accuracy, occasionally producing errors without indicating uncertainty in its responses. Consequently, while ChatGPT displays substantial promise, its application in e-learning settings is not mature due to observed inaccuracies. Furthermore, we introduced MUSILYAN, a specialised software tool designed for musicological and lyrical analysis, complementing ChatGPT's capabilities. While Chat-GPT excels in natural language understanding and generation, MUSILYAN offers structured semantic content management and thematic organisation of lyrics. The integration of ChatGPT and MUSILYAN holds promise for enhancing the exploration and understanding of poetry and lyrics.},

  abstract={The emergence of deep learning at the beginning of the last decade has driven the advancement of complex models, culminating in the development of large language models and generative AI. These models represent the summit of size and complexity. Explainability should be an option that plays a key role in enabling understandable the AI-assisted decision-making and ensuring accountability. This contribution delves into the complexities of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) through various perspectives, considering the extensive and growing body of literature. Our discussion begins by addressing the challenges posed by complex data, models, and high-risk scenarios. Given the rapid growth of the field, it is essential to tackle the criticisms and challenges that emerge as it matures, requiring thorough exploration. This contribution explores them, along with three aspects that may shed light on them. First, it is focused on the lack of definitional cohesion, examining how and why is defined XAI from the perspectives of audience and understanding. Second, it explores XAI explanations, bridging the gap between complex AI models and human understanding. Third, it is crucial to consider how to analyze and evaluate the maturity level of explainability, from a triple dimension, practicality, governance and auditability.},
