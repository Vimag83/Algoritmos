  abstract={Modern Chatbots represent a significant advancement in human-computer interaction by integrating emotional intelligence into their design. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined rules and keyword recognition, these advanced systems use affective computing and sentiment analysis to understand and respond to user’s emotional states. By using large LLMs, this innovation brings several key benefits. It enhances efficiency by providing immediate, relevant answers without users needing to search through multiple sources. The chatbot delivers precise information tailored to the emotional context of the interaction. Additionally, these chatbots offer greater convenience by consolidating information into a single query, streamlining the user experience and reducing the need to navigate through various platforms. They have improved so much yet are so much limited. An emotion sensitive chatbots should recognize and respond to emotional cues, fostering a deeper connection with users, encouraging regular interaction, creating a more interactive and personalized experience while also offering valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, enabling organizations to refine their marketing strategies and product development efforts. Overall, emotion-based chatbots should bridge the gap for human digital interactions. In this view, this paper explores how Generative AI, its technology, various applications, how it can be improved via enhancing the Human-Computer Interface, how does the improved version fare against current version, its various new applications, and additional key challenges and research prospectives.},

  abstract={Technology development has brought us to a time when generative AI, such as Stable Diffusion in LeonardoAI, can make the work of a character designer easier. Generative AI can accelerate the character design process, especially at the empathy stage, studying the visual preferences of the target audience and exploring alternative visual styles. In a case study of designing an animated series as content to accompany meals for people aged 25-30 years who like to watch movies while eating, the authors try to shorten the character design process using LeonardoAI. The authors try to understand the visual preferences of the target audience using a quantitative method, using a questionnaire filled with questions about the images generated by LeonardoAI. The questionnaire results became the basis for the character design ideas for the animated series ‘Genset Gang’ using keywords to develop the character's visuals. The authors found that using LeonardoAI can speed up the character design process because it can produce many images quickly, although its use has challenges. After all, LeonardoAI relies heavily on the character designer's ability to translate his ideas into prompt text and how the instruction code is successfully written.},

  abstract={This work aims to explore the innovative fusion of image style transfer technology and pattern derivative design, and seek new avenues for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with China's intangible cultural heritage. The batch processing and high efficiency characteristics of AI technology are adopted and derivative design is taken as a medium to effectively disseminate black copper patterns infused with silver. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models from deep learning are employed and tuned with appropriate parameters. The deep learning framework realizes the generation of black copper patterns infused with silver. Furthermore, by incorporating image style transfer algorithms, novel pattern aesthetics are designed while preserving the distinctive features of black copper patterns infused with silver. Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles.

  abstract={The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the content creation to produce creative aspects like editing, audience analysis, creating ideas, writing copy, etc. The major aim is to streamline and automate the process of content creation and convert it into a more efficient and effective way. There is a lack of transparency in the AI content production process and hence it does not exactly mimic human activities, which includes fantasizing and picking up new abilities. AI content creation requires more creativity while investigating with a specific goal in mind. Although, AI faces many challenges since it constantly expands its base knowledge. One of the biggest ethical problems is the probability that AI content is used to deceive or influence people. Hence, to overcome these difficulties a machine learning-based Artificial Intelligent content creation framework is generated for content creation in Ad-supported TV. Here, an effective model Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) introduced to deliver enterprise data, customize descriptions, and adjust content based on consumer behaviors. This developed model produces material that is closely related to the preferences of the user. AI content creation increases efficiency and productivity by saving time and money. It also leads to the development of better content. Finally, the experimental analysis is performed to find the effectiveness of the developed deep learning-based AI content creation framework via various metrics.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is a task in artificial intelligence where an intelligent agent is required to answer questions about its environment. For example, to answer a question such as "Is the TV on or off?", the agent must navigate to the room with the TV and answer with either "On." or "Off." after recognizing the status. Unlike traditional question-answering systems that rely solely on text or static images, EQA involves agents that can move through a physical or simulated space, interact with the environment, and gather information to respond accurately. The agent must interpret both visual and linguistic inputs, navigate the environment, and complete tasks or locate objects based on the user’s questions. However, in the real world, the agent always faces unseen environments (i.e. different people’s houses), which makes the pre-trained model fail. Meanwhile, re-training in an unseen environment can cause high costs. Therefore, it is significant for the agent to learn continually by itself to cope with the challenges of unseen environments. In this work, we proposed a continual learning method based on generative adversarial imitation learning and self-supervision to support the agent when facing unseen environments. Besides, we designed a policy generator and policy quality discriminator to generate action policy sequences and evaluate the quality of the policy, respectively. Extensive experiments on the MP3D-EQA dataset demonstrate that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract={This article presents a controlled case study focused on implementing and using generative artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), in physiotherapy education to assist instructors with formulating effective technology-mediated feedback for students. It outlines how these advanced technologies have been integrated into an existing feedback-oriented platform to guide instructors in providing feedback inputs and establish a reference framework for future innovations in practical skills training for health professions education. Specifically, the proposed solution uses LLMs to automatically evaluate feedback inputs made by instructors based on predefined and literature-based quality criteria and generates actionable textual explanations for reformulation. In addition, if the instructor requires, the tool supports summary generation for large sets of text inputs to achieve better student reception and understanding. The case study describes how these features were integrated into the feedback-oriented platform, how their effectiveness was evaluated in a controlled setting with documented feedback inputs, and the results of its implementation with real users through cognitive walkthroughs. Initial results indicate that this innovative implementation holds great potential to enhance learning and performance in physiotherapy education and has the potential to expand to other health disciplines where the development of procedural skills is critical, offering a valuable tool to assess and improve feedback based on quality standards for effective feedback processes. The cognitive walkthroughs allowed us to determine participants' usability decisions in the face of these new features and to evaluate the perceived usefulness, how this would integrate into their workload, and their opinion regarding the potential for the future within this teaching strategy. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for practice and future research directions in this developing field.},

  abstract={Contribution: This study offers an analysis of cybersecurity for continuing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we synthesized the literature and highlighted the possible cybersecurity risks and ethical concerns associated with advancements in AI. Background: Recent advancements in AI have implicated various risks and ethical concerns regarding cybersecurity. Prior literature studies have highlighted a plethora of these issues. We have conducted a systematic review to analyze the issues presented in the prior literature. Analyzing the issues presented has allowed us to answer one research question. Research Question: Our study answered one research question: Given the continuous advancements in artificial intelligence, what are cybersecurity's potential risks and ethical concerns? Methodology: We utilized the IEEE Xplore database to answer the research question. After setting the search criteria to journal articles posted between 2019 and 2024, we found 67 articles relevant to our keywords. After screening, we finalized 16 articles to address our research question. The articles selected were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Articles were then categorized into three different themes: (1) social engineering, (2) misinformation and fake news, and (3) hacking. Findings: Our findings indicate that researchers have informed us about the malicious use of AI in cybersecurity by classifying attacks into three themes. These themes indicate the manner of attack. Furthermore, we find that the major risks and ethical concerns regarding the application of AI in cybersecurity relate to the preservation of privacy. As the field of artificial intelligence continues to grow, we see that it is imperative to continue monitoring the safety of this technology. For researchers to serve the public, future work should aim to translate technical terminology into more digestible phrases for those not knowledgeable in the field.},

  abstract={In the current era of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom, most image generation models rely solely on prompt-based input to generate images. Often it is very challenging for a user to convey their ideas using textual prompts, thus resulting in images that differ significantly from user's intended vision. The proposed AI image generation system enables users to input a rough sketch, which is then transformed into a refined and accurate image closely aligned with the original sketch. This is achieved by integration of multiple state of art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as pix2pix (image translation), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC GAN), Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGANs) (image restoration). This AI system makes image generation tasks more intuitive and aligned with user expectations. This method could improve design processes in fields like fashion and architecture.},
