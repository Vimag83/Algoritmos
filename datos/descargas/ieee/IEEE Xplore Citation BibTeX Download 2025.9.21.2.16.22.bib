  abstract={The advent of ChatGPT has initiated a boom in the use of artificial intelligence tools in society. From their initial spontaneous application in education, we are gradually moving toward a more thoughtful and systematic approach. To better understand the current state of AI utilization in education, we conducted our own EU Code Week 2024 activity titled “Programming an Animated Music Clip”. The aim of this activity was to foster positive attitudes toward programming among students and teachers, enhance their multimedia literacy, and encourage creativity using artificial intelligence tools. The outcome of this activity is a publicly available collection of animated music clips created by students and teachers from primary, secondary, and higher education institutions. In the article, we analyse the impact of AI utilization on the final projects of the authors. The analysis was carried out using automated tools (Formal Concept Analysis, Dr. Scratch, custom automated tool, R program) and human evaluation. We examined the projects from various perspectives, such as the artificial intelligence tools used, the proportion of multimedia created by humans versus AI, the programming complexity of the projects, and the level of creativity of the authors. In the subsequent section of the article, we present the identified relationships between these aspects and provide recommendations for integrating AI into the teaching process.},

  abstract={In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its way into the creative and cultural industries, opening up new challenges and opportunities, poorly sufficiently explored today. However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity. The findings underline the importance of establishing specific sectoral ethical guidelines for AI in the field of tangible and intangible CH to support and enhance its sustainable development without compromising its values, significance, sense of belonging and strong social impact.},

  abstract={This study examines public opinions, emotional tendencies, and psychological linguistic characteristics associated with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and the advanced video generation model, Sora, by analyzing discussions on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. A total of 24,727 valid user-generated texts (1,762,296 words) were collected and analyzed using Python and its associated APIs. Word co-occurrence network analysis, topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and emotional characteristics based on the DLUT Emotion Ontology and psycholinguistic analyses based on the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary were employed to explore public views on these generative AI technologies. The findings reveal a shift in public focus over time, from initial excitement about technological advancements to growing interest in commercialization, labor, education, ethics, and global competition. The public’s emotional responses to AI were a mix of excitement and apprehension. The study identifies seven distinct emotional types, providing a nuanced understanding of public psychological reactions, which contrasts with previous binary classifications. This research contributes valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers, highlighting the public’s evolving acceptance of generative AI technologies.},

  abstract={In various monitoring, tracking, and control applications, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are gaining popularity. To fully utilize the promise of WSNs in various applications, two significant challenges - power efficiency and scalability - must be overcome. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as deep learning, machine learning (ML), and reinforcement learning, present fresh perspectives and development opportunities for WSNs to make wise decisions and effectively use resources. For example, AI-based techniques can enable WSNs to learn the underlying patterns and trends in the data streams exchanged among different sensor nodes, and choose optimal parameters for efficient data collection and analysis.},

  abstract={In recent years, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN), Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN), and Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) have generally been well-received in Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry. This paper first briefly introduces the fundamentals of GAN, CGAN, and DCGAN. Next, we focus on comparing two improved GAN variants– CGAN and DCGAN. To be specific, we train them with certain architectural constraints on two datasets – MNIST and Animation images. We show convincing evidence that DCGAN outperforms CGAN in terms of processing image datasets to a large extent. Additionally, we make a Graphical User Interface (GUI), enabling users to choose face photos with different tags generated by DCGAN.},

  abstract={The advancements in automated problem-solving were explored by the agents of Artificial Intelligence (AI)Generated Content (AIGC). Although existing AIGC-based AI Agent systems can solve simple tasks, it is complicated to handle complex tasks due to inconsistent work logic. In this research, the operating mechanism of AI Agents was dissected to elucidate why AIGC is suitable as the foundation for AI Agents. Based on this technology, we proposed an AI Agent framework named SOP-GPT which has integrated the concept of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) from human workflow into AI Agents. SOP-GPT comprises three main elements: process, role, and skills. By combining the generative capability of AIGC with human SOP mechanisms, the quality of generation was enhanced to meet the expectations of human work requirements. We further explored how to assemble an AIGC engineering process for the division of labor and collaboration methods between various functional departments or units in enterprises in this framework. This research results provide a perspective for human management experience to enhance the capabilities of AI Agents and provide direction for future research.},
