  abstract={Text-to-Image Synthesis has gained significant attention due to its ability to generate realistic visuals from textual descriptions. Existing methods, such as Attention-based GAN s and Transformer models, often face challenges in maintaining semantic alignment between text and images, handling complex textual inputs, and ensuring high-quality outputs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) framework leveraging GloVe embeddings for semantic representation. The Oxford 102 Flower dataset, comprising image-text pairs, is used to train and evaluate the model. The DC-GAN architecture includes a generator to synthesize images and a discriminator to validate authenticity, enabling iterative improvement. Evaluation metrics show an average Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) score of 0.286 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.455, demonstrating semantic coherence and low pixel-level deviations. Challenges such as refining fine-grained image details and enhancing robustness across diverse datasets persist. This study highlights the potential of DC-GAN for multimodal AI applications, including targeted advertising, virtual reality, and creative design. By advancing text-to-image synthesis, the research provides a robust framework for future exploration in generating semantically consistent and high-quality visuals from text.},

This paper is focused on one of the applications of PC Vision. We humans can read, listen, imagine, visualize, and extract an image out from the conveyed text in our brain and even we can draw it. By using artificial intelligence our evolving machines can also do the same. Videography is a very vast field and as the consumers of smart devices are increasing we know that evolution in the field of videography is also required. By the constant evolution in the field of computer vision using deep learning, our smart devices are capable of portraying images or video from static or dynamic data in the form of text. By using PC Vision we can develop the raw image by organization development of text input. Dynamic components are executed by changing over the data text into an image channel. And the basic methodology of converting is by processing all the available image data on the internet and collecting them in a dataset and then by using deep learning we will correlate it with text data. The troubles are picking key articulations to highlight in the video, removing the meaning of the text, and showing them in a video showing simply the elements and reliably a huge articulation},

  abstract={There is tremendous amount of computational power in artificial intelligence models like computing variety of complex mathematical calculations and recognizing objects. In the past six to seven years, the amount of computing power used by record-breaking AI models doubled frequently in the time span of months. An interesting way in which these models learn and progress is through deep learning. Deep learning is an intelligent machine’s way in which machines learn without being supervised by us and grants them the power to recognize speech, translate, and even make or take data-driven decisions. Machines consider this as a studying method, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and how we learn. An important deep learning method where we train the machines on information that is unlabeled is called unsupervised learning. A strong part of neural networks that are utilized for unsupervised learning is Generative Adversarial Networks. When it comes to applications on images quality improvement, Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN) have a key role to play in it. It was proposed by researchers at Twitter. The motive of this GAN is to super resolute the fine textures of the image by upscaling it. In order to enhance the images further, ESRGAN is used. As the name suggests, ESRGAN is an implementation of SRGAN and uses some added components of SRGAN.},

  abstract={Imagine if technology could help doctors see clearer and predict diseases earlier. That's what this project is all about. We're combining two powerful technologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML), to shake up how we handle medical images and reports. First up, we're using GANs to make medical images sharper and more useful. Thinkof it like giving doctors super-clear glasses to spot details that might be hard to see otherwise. Then, we're using AIML to predict diseases by looking at these images and other patient info. It's like having a crystal ball that helps doctors catch problems before they get serious. But that's not all. We're also creating a smart system that writes brief but super-helpfulsummaries of these medical reports. It's like having an assistant who reads all the details and pulls out the most important parts, making it easier for doctors to decide what's next. By bringing together these technologies, we're not just making diagnoses more accurate and predicting diseases sooner, but we're also making sure doctors get the key info they need quickly.

  abstract={The degradation of color in historical paintings poses a significant challenge to art preservation, diminishing the vibrancy and authenticity of masterpieces over time. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize color restoration in historical artworks. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), AI systems can analyze faded paintings and reconstruct their original hues with unprecedented precision. Using large datasets of high-resolution images, these algorithms learn patterns of pigment degradation and stylistic nuances inherent to specific artists or periods. The study highlights how AI models, trained on multispectral and hyperspectral imaging data, can infer the original color schemes by detecting remnants of pigments invisible to the naked eye. Moreover, AI-driven simulations offer insights into artistic intent and historical contexts, enabling restorers to make informed decisions. This interdisciplinary approach merges art history, chemistry, and computer science, fostering a new era of cultural heritage preservation. The findings underscore AI's transformative role in safeguarding the visual integrity of humanity's artistic legacy while maintaining the ethical considerations of artistic authenticity and conservation standards.},

This study addresses the class imbalance challenge using generative artificial intelligence (GAI), employing a conditional generative adversarial network (CTGAN) to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. Following data augmentation, six representative machine learning models, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM, are evaluated and compared using two real-world datasets from Taiwan and the USA. The CTGAN-based synthetic data generation approach is further compared with alternative methods, including the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Gaussian copula data generators. Experimental results demonstrate that the workflow combining CTGAN and LightGBM achieves the highest prediction performance, measured by F1 score, on both datasets. It also outperforms baseline methods from previous studies, highlighting the effectiveness of GAI in addressing the class imbalance problem in corporate bankruptcy prediction.},

  pages={1224-1228},
  abstract={This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, named GARL (Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning), for intra-day optimization dispatch in high-proportion new energy grid. The proposed method embeds a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) within the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework to learn the reward distribution of the power grid in the future operation situation, so as to realize the cumulative reward prediction in the dispatching period and ensure the optimization of the dispatching decision. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the SG-126 power grid simulator under three representative scenarios to evaluate the performance and generalization capability of GARL. The results show that GARL can learn the distribution characteristics of stateaction-reward sequence from historical experience, establish the mapping relationship between current state and future cumulative reward, and improve the accuracy of future power grid operation trend prediction, which is always better than the independent DDPG algorithm. Furthermore, the study explores the potential of transfer learning between scenarios and finds that GARL exhibits a promising generalization capability.},

  pages={18366-18385},
  abstract={This study investigates factors influencing the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, focusing on attitudes and intentions toward its use. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Support Theory (SST), the research examines perceived usefulness, ease of use, and support measures, including educational and emotional support. The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.160$ , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( $\beta = 0.140$ , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.670$ , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( $\beta = 0.330$ , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( $\beta = 0.760$ , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.},

  abstract={Data augmentation is a widespread innovative technique in Artificial Intelligence: it aims at creating new synthetic data given an existing real baseline, thus allowing to overcome the issues arising from the lack of labelled data for proper training of classification algorithms. Our paper focuses on how a common data augmentation methodology, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is widespread for images and timeseries data, can be also applied to generate multivariate data. We propose a novel scheme for GANs evaluation, based on the performance of an explainable AI (XAI) algorithm and an innovative definition of rule similarity. In particular, we will consider an application dealing with the augmentation of Inertial Movement Units (IMU) data for physical fatigue monitoring in two age subgroups (under and over 40 years old) of the original data. We will show how our innovative rule similarity metric can drive the selection of the best fake dataset among a set of different candidates, corresponding to different GAN training runs.},

  title={The Responsible Development of Automated Student Feedback with Generative AI}, 
  year={2025},

  abstract={Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback, effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a “tyranny of the majority”, where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback, therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated, how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current needs of diverse student populations. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for ethical integrity but also for building the operational trust needed to integrate AI-driven systems as valuable tools in contemporary education. Thoughtful planning and deliberate choices are needed to ensure that these solutions truly benefit all students, allowing AI to support an inclusive and dynamic learning environment.},

  abstract={A microgrid can be formed by the integration of different components such as loads, renewable/conventional units, and energy storage systems in a local area. Microgrids with the advantages of being flexible, environmentally friendly, and self-sufficient can improve the power system performance metrics such as resiliency and reliability. However, the design and implementation of microgrids are always faced with different challenges considering the uncertainties associated with loads and renewable energy resources, sudden load variations, energy management of several energy resources, etc. Therefore, it is required to employ such rapid and accurate methods, as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, to address these challenges and improve the MG's efficiency, stability, security, and reliability. Utilization of AI helps to develop systems as intelligent as humans to learn, decide, and solve problems. This article presents a review on different applications of AI-based techniques in microgrids such as energy management, load and generation forecasting, protection, power electronics control, and cyber security. Different AI tasks such as regression and classification in microgrids are discussed using methods including machine learning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, etc. The advantages, limitation, and future trends of AI applications in microgrids are discussed.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks or GANS, are another way of achieving generative modeling using various deep learning methods like convoluted neural networks. They have a wide range of applications like :- image to image translation, improving the resolution of the images, creating multiple images using a single image, checking if the image is real or fake and the list goes on. One of the implementations of GANS, i.e, DCGANS would be discussed in this paper. DCGANS stands for Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, it uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the generator and discriminator, respectively. This DCGANS give prompt result while processing many real time images. In their study Unsupervised representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, Radford et al. proposed it. This algorithm generates fake images after being trained on a dataset of human faces. However to create these fake images, the quality of these images should be compromised and this can also make them easily identifiable as fake image. So, here StyleGANS will be used as another implementation of GANS. StyleGANS is not only used for improving the quality of these images but also it helps us to increase fakeness of the images. This project uses the CelebA dataset from Kaggle to train the models.},

  abstract={This paper discusses securities and cryptocurrency trading using artificial intelligence (AI) in the sense that it focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on selected technical indicators before proceeding to modelling, and then to develop more practical models by introducing new reward loss function that maximizes the returns during training phase. The results of EDA reveal that the complex patterns within the data can be better captured by discriminative classification models and this was endorsed by performing back-testing on two securities using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as discriminative models against their counterpart Naïve Bayes as a generative model. To enhance the learning process, the new reward loss function is utilized to retrain the ANN with testing on AAPL, IBM, BRENT CRUDE and BTC using auto-trading strategy that serves as the intelligent unit, and the results indicate this loss superiorly outperforms the conventional cross-entropy used in predictive models. The overall results of this work suggest that there should be larger focus on EDA and more practical losses in the research of machine learning modelling for stock market prediction applications.},

  abstract={Lifelong learning describes an ability that enables humans to continually acquire and learn new information without forgetting. This capability, common to humans and animals, has lately been identified as an essential function for an artificial intelligence system aiming to learn continuously from a stream of data during a certain period of time. However, modern neural networks suffer from degenerated performance when learning multiple domains sequentially and fail to recognize past learned tasks after being retrained. This corresponds to catastrophic forgetting and is ultimately induced by replacing the parameters associated with previously learned tasks with new values. One approach in lifelong learning is the generative replay mechanism (GRM) that trains a powerful generator as the generative replay network, implemented by a variational autoencoder (VAE) or a generative adversarial network (GAN). In this article, we study the forgetting behavior of GRM-based learning systems by developing a new theoretical framework in which the forgetting process is expressed as an increase in the model’s risk during the training. Although many recent attempts have provided high-quality generative replay samples by using GANs, they are limited to mainly downstream tasks due to the lack of inference. Inspired by the theoretical analysis while aiming to address the drawbacks of existing approaches, we propose the lifelong generative adversarial autoencoder (LGAA). LGAA consists of a generative replay network and three inference models, each addressing the inference of a different type of latent variable. The experimental results show that LGAA learns novel visual concepts without forgetting and can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence into educational tools is transforming learning environments. In computer science, students frequently encounter challenges with complex concepts and practical applications. While LLMs offer valuable support, their responses can sometimes lack precision or rely on outdated information. Addressing these limitations is essential to enhance the effectiveness of AI-based tools in educational support. The main objective of this paper is to propose a tool-based RAG as automated assistant in an OOP Course. The tool was tested using common student queries and its responses were compared with those generated by ChatGPT. Initial observations suggest that RAG consistently generated contextually relevant responses due to its ability to access pertinent information from a structured knowledge base, resulting in more precise and applicable answers for students. The introduction of a RAG-based tool in classrooms has the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant, tailored responses to specific queries.},
