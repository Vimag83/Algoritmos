  abstract={In fabric design, cultural symbolism is the basis, encompassing cultural heritage, identity, and artistic expression. With the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the contemporary designers are capable of effectively working towards incorporating traditional motifs into modern textiles. This study examines how AI contributes to the creation of culturally inspired fabric patterns, with a focus on achieving a balance between complexity of patterns and their authentic representation. Studying the data and models, the result shows that the aesthetic appeal and cultural relevance of the patterns generated by AI that is obtained is relatively high, especially at moderate complexity. Through design automation and optimization, AI could be an innovative tool for cultural heritage preservation, as well as artistic exploration. These results demonstrate the transformative potential of AI in textile design, connecting old traditions to new contemporaneity. Such research is relevant to AI-enhanced creative domains as a proof-of-concept for adopting such systems for the generation of digital fabric design and cultural preservation.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Today, numerical controls (CNC) are the standard for the control of machine tools and industrial robots in production and enable highly flexible and efficient production, especially for frequently changing production tasks. A numerical control has discrete inputs and outputs. Within the NC channel, however, it is necessary to analytically describe curves for the calculation of the position setpoints and the jerk limitation. The resulting change between discrete and continuous description forms and the considerable restrictions in the parallelisation of the interpolation of continuous curves within the NC channel lead to a performance overhead that limits the performance of the NC channel with regard to the calculation of new position setpoints. This can lead to a drop in production speed and thus to longer production times. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach in this paper. This is based on the use of deep generative models and allows the direct generation of interpolated toolpaths without calculation of continuous curves and subsequent discretization. The generative models are being trained to create curves of certain types such as linear and parabolic curves or splines directly as discrete point sequences. This approach is very well feasible with regard to its parallelization and reduces the computing effort within the NC channel. First results with straight lines and parabolic curves show the feasibility of this new approach for the generation of CNC toolpaths.},

  abstract={Cancer is a multifactorial disease, associated with several alterations at various molecular levels, which provides a favorable and selective advantage for aberrant cell growth. Enormous genetic alterations in cancer can be captured through next-generation sequencing. The analysis of high-dimensional data from sequencing experiments requires a huge amount of computational power, which can be addressed using algorithms in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML). Early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have been instrumental in clinical research due to its ability to assist clinicians to make a more informed treatment decision. The visualization of tumor growth and its genetic cause is an essential part of cancer treatment. Here, AI/ML can address this by analyzing and linking the image-derived data to genomics data from cancer patients. In this work, we present a review of recent advances in image analysis using ML/AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to that, we have discussed the recent methods of genomic data analysis for cancer classification and biomarker discovery.},

This promise motivated the development of Learning Analytics (LA) as a research and practical field and the use of insights derived from learning trace data for evidence-based decision making in a variety of educational settings. While LA has made a significant contribution to better understanding of learning and the environments in which it takes place, many open questions and challenges remain. Furthermore, new opportunities and challenges continue to emerge with the ever-changing modalities of teaching and learning, the latest of which are associated with the rapid development and accessibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

  abstract={The article is devoted to the transformation of the processes of deep mediatization of social relations in a ratified digital society, due to the intensive introduction of self-learning neural networks and, more broadly, generative artificial intelligence. The characteristic of the current stage of mediatization is given, and an overview of the relevant theoretical approaches is proposed. The influence of artificial intelligence technologies on mediatization processes is considered, positive and negative effects are identified, and the most significant risks are analyzed. Special attention is paid to such phenomena with negative potential as the deepening of the digital divide, manipulation of public opinion and its exploitation with the use of deep fakes, preservation of bubbles and echo chambers, algorithmic bias and cultural homogenization.},

  abstract={The exponential growth of data and information has led to unprecedented opportunities and challenges in processing, analyzing, and utilizing this vast amount of knowledge. Nowadays, with the emerging and evolving of some novel strong Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, especially GPT (short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer), it suddenly becomes possible for traditional information providers (such as Libraries, Data Intelligence Service Centers) to conduct business from resource and content aggregation to high-level knowledge provision. After analyzing the status of information businesses and mechanism of GPT, in this article, several possible changes and some corresponsive measures to achieve a higher intelligent level of knowledge service for traditional information providers are mainly discussed in depth. It's expected that such exploration will provide meaningful reference for facilitating the intelligent development of traditional information services.},

  abstract={As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as a transformative technology in higher education, particularly in programming instruction. However, its impact on learning, motivation, and the educational environment must still be fully understood. This study aims to determine the capacity of GenAI to generate effective computer programming learning in STEM university students, comparing it with active learning methods based on video. An experiment was conducted with 40 computer engineering students divided into two groups: one using GenAI (Google Gemini 1.5) and another employing educational videos. Pre- and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the learning environment. No significant differences in learning were found between the groups. However, GenAI significantly increased perceived autonomy and reduced perceived effort and pressure, while video-based learning significantly improved perceived competence. These findings suggest that both methods seem to motivate in diverse ways and that they could complement each other in an integrated teaching approach, offering new perspectives for designing programming learning environments in higher education.},
