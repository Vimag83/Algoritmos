  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, the detection and governance of fake news has become a hot topic of concern in academia and society. The wide dissemination of fake news not only disrupts the public's information perception but also triggers social phenomena such as information epidemics, posing significant challenges to social stability, political environment and public health. Especially driven by social media, the speed and breadth of information dissemination have greatly intensified the spread of fake news. The research findings indicate that Generative AI mainly focuses on the optimization of natural language processing and deep learning technologies, providing new technical support for the detection of fake news. Meanwhile, the role of social media platforms and information dissemination pathways have become the focus of scholars' attention. However, issues such as the dissemination of cross-platform fake news, the practical application of generative AI, and the accuracy and robustness of algorithms remain the main challenges in current research. In this regard, this article suggests that future research should further optimize large-scale language models, promote innovation in multimodal fake news detection technology, and strengthen research on cross platform fake news dissemination mechanisms, in order to provide more accurate and effective technical support for fake news governance and alleviate its negative impact on society.},

  abstract={With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology, its potential applications in education are becoming increasingly broad. Currently, practical operation courses in higher education institutions face various issues such as low classroom interaction, uneven student development, lack of resources, and imperfect evaluation systems. AIGC technology, with its unique advantages, has brought new hope for addressing these challenges. This paper explores the feasibility of applying AIGC technology in practical operation courses in higher education institutions, based on the existing problems in teaching. It proposes a " Teacher-Student-AIGC " teaching strategy that integrates AIGC for these courses. Taking the course "Image Processing Technology" as an example, the paper specifically demonstrates the innovative application and implementation strategy of AIGC technology in practical operation teaching. The aim is to provide a practical reference plan for the teaching reform of practical courses in higher education institutions.},

  title={Advancing Type 2 Diabetes Management: Digital Twin and AI for Dynamic Dosing and Nutrition}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by insulin resistance and dysfunctional glucose regulation that affects millions of individuals worldwide. However, managing T2D is challenging because blood glucose levels fluctuate due to diet, exercise, and patients’ idiosyncrasies. Approaches such as real-time monitoring, predictive modeling, and personalized treatment have been among the major breakthroughs in the field. Still, their holistic integration for dynamic dosing and dietary optimization has remained largely unexplored. This research analyzes insights from recent research that reveal different methodologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and predictive models in improving diabetes management outcomes. Some studies showed up to 1.5% HbA1c reduction and time-in-range improvement by 20% to 25% due to artificial intelligence (AI) driven interventions. The accuracy of blood glucose prediction in these studies ranged from 85% to 95%, thus showing that these models can control blood sugar levels at any given moment. The preliminary results show that dynamic dosing models combined with dietary recommendations may achieve a 0.8% to 1.2% decrease in HbA1c and a 10% to 15% improvement in overall glycemic control. This study investigates the applications of Digital Twin (DT) technology, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Generative AI (Gen AI) in diabetic control systems. The proposed model adopts these strategies to illustrate the possibility of connecting the existing research gaps and prepare for future developments on adaptive AI-powered framework for diabetes care.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work-in-Progress paper presents a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary AI-cybersecurity knowledge. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Ensemble classifiers are constructed from various component classifiers by aggregating the results of the individual classifiers in some manner. While there are many ways to do this, one of the least computationally intensive is to use a voting ensemble, where the vote of each classifier is weighted by a number representing its performance. Choosing the appropriate weights is an involved process, that ranges from using trial and error to using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique that uses generative adversarial networks to customize the weights used for each individual input to the ensemble. Specifically, we propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks to generate the weights, with the input image acting as the label to the network and the appropriate weight being the output. We test the proposed system on an image classification task and show that the proposed method produces better results than using fixed weights by 2.43 percent.},

  abstract={We propose a deblurring method that integrates a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and encoder-decoder models. Our approach offers higher efficiency and reduced training complexity compared to generative deblurring models which utilizing GANs as the backbone network. In this approach, we employ the encoder as the feature extraction module, and then passes the features to the GANs for deblurring, followed by image reconstruction using the decoder as the last module. To ensure image fidelity, skip connections are introduced between the encoder and decoder. Meanwhile, we introduce a targeted training methodology designed to mitigate fluctuations in network parameters, thereby maximizing the efficacy of the model’s training velocity. We additionally conducted comparative evaluations based on the GoPro and Kohler datasets, contrasting our model against previously proposed algorithms to approve its exceptional performance in deblurring efficacy and efficiency.},

  abstract={A new algorithm framework is proposed, which combines the self-attention mechanism and the transformer model, to enhance the efficiency and quality of the creation of digital creative content. The system realizes the semantic understanding and generation tasks of multimodal data by designing a multi-layer Transformer architecture, and fully exploits the context modeling ability of the self-attention mechanism. To verify the performance of the algorithm, this paper simulates the model in image generation, text generation and multimodal content generation tasks. The test results show that the system has achieved significant improvements in the coherence, diversity and innovation of the generated content. Experiments on a public dataset show that the BLEU score of the generated text content is 12.3% higher than that of the traditional method, the FID index of image generation is reduced by 15.7%, and the semantic consistency score of multimodal generation reaches 92.4%. These results prove the superiority and practicality of the proposed algorithm. This research not only provides a new way to generate digital creative content, but also provides a theoretical basis for the further integration of AI and creative industry.},

  abstract={Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging and quickly advancing field that combines the subsymbolic strengths of (deep) neural networks and the explicit, symbolic knowledge contained in knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance explainability and safety in AI systems. This approach addresses a key criticism of current generation systems, namely, their inability to generate human-understandable explanations for their outcomes and ensure safe behaviors, especially in scenarios with unknown unknowns (e.g., cybersecurity, privacy). The integration of neural networks, which excel at exploring complex data spaces, and symbolic KGs, which represent domain knowledge, allows AI systems to reason, learn, and generalize in a manner understandable to experts. This article describes how applications in cybersecurity and privacy, two of the most demanding domains in terms of the need for AI to be explainable while being highly accurate in complex environments, can benefit from neurosymbolic AI.},

  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence, the anomaly detection plays more and more important role in security monitoring field. Because it is difficult to label abnormal data, most of the supervised methods consumed a lot of manpower and obtained low performance and generality. Inspired by this motivation, this paper proposes a semi-supervised method for anomaly detection in video frames based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), in which only normal data was used as the training sample. The quality gap between the predicted frame and the ground truth is used as the basis to determine whether it is abnormal. Moreover, the mathematical morphology approach was adopted to locate the anomaly area in the frames. Experiments show that our method can successfully detect abnormal frames in video and can also locate the area where abnormal behavior occurs in frames.},

  abstract={Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technology for measuring human physiological indicators. The rPPG signal is extracted through the periodic changes of the facial skin in the facial video. The rPPG signal extracted by most existing rPPG methods has low quality, and it only can be used for average heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), etc. But for the field of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, higher quality rPPG signals are needed. This paper introduces a novel and efficient generative adversarial network method defined as rPPGGAN, which denoises and enhances the original rPPG signal extracted by a deep learning rPPG method to make it closer to the real rPPG signal. The HRV indicators were verified on the public datasets UBFC-rPPG and PURE, and both the time-domain indicators and frequency-domain indicators have been effectively improved. The method proposed in this paper is lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate. It can effectively improve the rPPG signal quality after being integrated with other rPPG methods.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the ethical-legal issues underlying the implementation of Large Language Models, in the aftermath of the European Union Parliament's approval of the Artificial Intelligence Regulation. In very recent years, there has been a rapid evolution and multiform implementation of the so-called Artificial Intelligence. Notably, one significant development in AI is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks based on a set of established rules. Artificial Intelligence has recently undergone a significant revolution that has led to a radical paradigm shift, represented by the so-called Foundation Models, which have two main characteristics: emergence and homogenisation. On the other hand, Language Modelling (LM) is one of the main approaches to advance the linguistic intelligence of machines and thus a Foundation Model trained on textual data. The most recent development of this approach can be found in the so-called Large Language Models (LLM). These take the form of artificial neural networks pre-trained on huge datasets which, instead of being dedicated to a specific task, can perform a wide range of different functions at a level that is all the more accurate the greater the resources made available to them. The concept of language models is not new but has evolved with the progress of artificial intelligence over the decades. In general, LLMs are mainly trained in industrial settings where many important details of training (e.g. data collection and cleaning) are not disclosed. Thus, it is difficult to align LLMs with human values or preferences. Despite their capabilities, LLMs are also likely to produce toxic, fictitious or harmful content. Therefore, effective and efficient control approaches are required to eliminate the potential risk arising from the use of LLMs. For the purposes of the study conducted, it is intended to describe the development and outcomes with the aim to show not only the evolution of the responses offered by various LLM, but also and above all the possible ethical and legal implications that can be deduced from these outputs. Several models have been used for the implementation of the experiments: two GPT-2 models, Perplexity, ChatGPT (version 3.5), Llama. The language used for the implementation of the experiments was English, as it is structurally more neutral. In particular, with reference to a topic with a strong ethical and legal impact such as suicide, different answers were offered by the various models used. In conclusion, the essay offers reflections on the results of the experiment with reference to the EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence represents for the jurist, not only European, a decisive challenge not only with regard to the categories of thought and formulation of operational languages, but above all with regard to the centrality of the human being. On the basis of these considerations, focusing on generative AI and in particular on Large Language Models, it is clear that many of the issues relating to copyright and the protection of personal data still remain unsolved, excluding those already regulated by the legislation on the point.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of social media, a large number of open-source emotion recognition datasets have emerged online, providing abundant resources for emotion recognition. Meanwhile, with the help of deep learning, multimodal emotion recognition technology has advanced rapidly. However, deep learning-based multimodal emotion recognition still has some drawbacks, such as requiring a large amount of training data, inconsistencies in the quantity and quality of data within datasets, and heterogeneity among different modalities in multimodal fusion. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal emotion recognition framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which enhances feature representation and reduces heterogeneity in multimodal fusion. Finally, we achieve promising experimental results on the RAVDESS dataset.},

  title={Development of a Methodology for Automated Backend Code Optimization Triggered from a Frontend Web Application Using Generative Artificial Intelligence Models}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In this paper, the authors introduce an innovative methodology for automating backend code optimization, triggered from the frontend of a web application and powered by advanced generative AI models. The proposed system integrates the Vue.js and Laravel frameworks, together with a PHP (Hypertext preprocessor) Parser and the OpenAI API (Application programming interface), enabling dynamic, real-time optimization without necessitating system downtime. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on offline environments or CI/CD (Continuous integration and continuous deployment) pipelines, this methodology facilitates continuous performance enhancement during active usage of web application. An experimental evaluation involving 20 functions within a Laravel application demonstrated a 70% optimization success rate, a 62.6% reduction in execution time and an 18.18% decrease in code lines. This approach preserves semantic consistency and provides reports to developers for further implementation. By reducing errors and enabling ongoing refinements, the work makes a significant contribution to the field of web application development.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled LLM agents to accomplish more complex tasks through interactions. However, in complex social interaction scenarios, LLM agents may still lack a certain degree of social intelligence. This paper proposes the automatic generation of an external repository of social skills by powerful LLMs like GPT-4 to guide agents in social interactions. Based on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, the proposed method utilizing relevance-based extraction and random sampling to choose appropriate strategies from the social skills repository to enhance the content generation of LLMs. The results demonstrate that this approach can effectively improves the social intelligence of agents across a variety of social interaction scenarios.},
