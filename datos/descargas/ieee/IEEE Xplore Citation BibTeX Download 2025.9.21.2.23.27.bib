  abstract={The planning, construction, and maintenance of sand-breaking systems around highway in Taklimakan SandSea mainly depend on expert's empirical knowledge, and face the problems of time-consuming management, unpredictable system performance, and few available data. This work proposes a management and control method of sand-breaking systems that follows artificial system, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) theory. Expert knowledge was extracted to develop artificial sand-breaking system. conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) was developed to achieve data augmentation. Computational experiments were implemented to evaluate artificial system performance by predicting whether the system can reach the set age limit. Using fuzzy control, the real sand-breaking system and the artificial one can learn from each other in parallel execution to provide decision support for sand-breaking system management. This approach provides a human–machine hybrid parallel intelligence system for complex sand-breaking systems management.},

  abstract={This paper has presented a case study in an undergraduate subject of Engineering Design, in which we implement the project-based learning (PBL) pedagogy and, in particular, introduce to students the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and encourage them to use such technology in their open projects as the assessment of relevant course. We use a typical case study of an interior design project, to demonstrate using the currently most popular AI technology, i.e. Stable Diffusion (SD), in classical engineering design. Working on this interior design project, various AI-based approaches have been implemented via SD, for a number of different interior design tasks. Results show that using SD with the state-of-the-art AI technology can generate expected design proposals very quickly and efficiently. Such project examples, under the PBL framework, whilst integrated with recent AI technology, can greatly motivate students’ learning and their performance.},

  pages={102-107},
  abstract={The Indo-Australian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Pacific Plate all converge where Indonesia is situated. As a result, Indonesia is a nation where earthquakes occur frequently. Some researchers have studied machine learning algorithms for categorizing earthquake vibrations. In this experiment, earthquake vibrations are categorized using the Artificial Neural Network method. We need appropriate datasets to obtain the maximum accuracy from the artificial neural network technique. The findings of this experiment show that feature extraction is required for the datasets to be trained to obtain a high accuracy value. The mean, median, maximum, minimum, skew, and kurtosis values are the feature that are extracted. In addition to employing feature extraction, it is crucial to modify the algorithm model. The experimental setup that uses “sigmoid” activation on the input layer, the three hidden layers, and the output layer yields the best accuracy when all feature are extracted, with training to test ratio of 90% to 10%. This is demonstrated by the exceptional training accuracy and testing accuracy values, which are 99.85 percent for training accuracy and 99.12 percent for validation accuracy. The mean value yields the highest accuracy result compared to employing just one feature extraction. Only 90.97 and 90.37 percent of training and validation accuracy are obtained when the mean is used alone for feature extraction.},

This study investigates the creation of AI agents that integrate state-of-the-art capabilities for decision-making and natural language interaction. Drawing on the fundamental concepts of AI agents, this research endeavors to enhance their functionality by seamlessly incorporating real-time Internet data into decision-making processes and implementing contextually aware conversation systems. The proposed AI agents were designed as independent entities capable of learning from data, making decisions, and executing actions without the need for direct human intervention. By leveraging language models (LLMs), these agents process vast amounts of data and continuously adapt and improve their performance over time. The integration of real-time Internet data enables agents to adjust their decision-making processes dynamically, ensuring prompt and well-informed responses to changing information. Contextually aware conversation systems empower these agents to engage in natural and personalized interactions, thereby fostering heightened user satisfaction and engagement. An intriguing aspect of AI agents is their capacity to learn and adapt to new situations without explicit programming in each unique scenario. Through continuous learning and interaction with the environment, AI agents have evolved to handle complex tasks efficiently and accurately. They can analyze patterns in large datasets, providing valuable insights and predictions across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. This research underscores a commitment to innovation, addressing existing limitations in AI technology and exploring its potential to advance artificial intelligence in practical business applications. By bridging the gap between traditional AI capabilities and emerging business needs, this research aims to contribute significantly to the development and implementation of intelligent AI agents in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={In an era where technology plays a significant role in the lives of people of all ages, adapting to rapidly advancing technology is essential. Lifelong learning, which integrates formal, non-formal, and informal education, helps learners develop skills and abilities independently. Programming skills serve as an example of lifelong learning, requiring the development of technical skills such as programming, planning, and testing, as well as communication, teamwork, and systematic thinking. This research focuses on utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to enhance programming skills through self-directed learning combined with interactive learning. The study was conducted with 21 students enrolled in the Higher Vocational Certificate (Diploma) program in Mechatronics and Robotics. The study applied the MAR model, which consists of three stages: The motivation stage, is designed to encourage learners to engage in activities that link prior knowledge or experiences with new knowledge, thereby fostering self-directed learning motivation, such as designing personalized learning activities based on individual interests; the Activity stage, which provides opportunities for learners to use Generative AI technology for self-directed learning according to their goals and plans, enabling them to understand concepts, apply knowledge in various situations, and track their learning progress; and the Reflection and Progress stage, focusing on reviewing, analyzing, and reflecting on learning outcomes, as well as exchanging ideas and skills with peers and receiving constructive feedback. These stages were designed based on theoretical foundations and a literature review. Furthermore, the research emphasized ethical considerations in AI use, such as data privacy and societal impacts, to promote high-quality, beneficial lifelong learning. The findings showed that before the learning process, the learner had no background in programming and had never used AI technology. However, after participating in the learning activities, students became more open to learning and responded positively to the self-designed activities, which aligned with their interests and skills related to their field of study. These findings suggest that this learning process, when implemented effectively, can be applied to lifelong learning for individuals of all genders and ages.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Formative assessment can be a powerful approach in influencing student mathematical motivation, and the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers more possibilities to do so, especially when using feedback for formative assessment. Nonetheless, the literature review of this study found limited development and research on investigating the impact of using generative AI-based formative feedback on student mathematical motivation. Therefore, this study examined the impact of implementing Class Optimization Master, generative AI-based formative feedback software, in promoting student mathematical motivation. The study employed a case study on fourth-grade students in a primary school in China. Semi-structured interviews with 21 students and two teachers were conducted face-to-face. Then, the interview data were analyzed by thematic analysis based on the three-dimensions theoretical framework of Mathematical Motivation Scale: Beliefs, Engagement, and Attitude. This study found that the use of AI-generated formative feedback enhanced student mathematical motivation by (1) boosting confidence, promoting socio-emotional interaction, and raising the importance of mathematics; (2) rewarding and inspiring a preference for mathematics; and (3) stimulating interest and mental-physical effort. These results provide insights for educators to design how to make use of AI-generated formative feedback to promote mathematical learning. It nonetheless calls for more research using quantitative methods and from different perspectives on this topic.},

  abstract={With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its application in educational settings has increasingly become a focal point, particularly in enhancing students’ analytical capabilities. This study examines the effectiveness of the ChatGPT prompt framework in improving text analysis skills among students, specifically targeting readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking. Conducted among high school students in Canada, the research assesses how GAI prompt frameworks significantly affect the quality of students’ analytical responses. Results showed significant improvements in all five aspects of readability, accuracy, completeness, logicality, and critical thinking, especially for students with no prior knowledge of the topic. However, enhancements in completeness and critical thinking were less pronounced, suggesting that while the ChatGPT framework substantially supports basic analytical skills, its effectiveness varies depending on the complexity of cognitive tasks and the extent of students’ existing knowledge. The study underscores the significant role that advanced GAI tools can play in modern educational environments, promoting deeper engagement with learning materials and enhancing students’ analytical abilities. It highlights the necessity of integrating these technologies to cater to diverse learning needs and cognitive challenges.},

  abstract={Generative AI is a new and rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new data or content. Although the concept of generating content was invented long back, the latest breakthroughs in neural network architectures have made it possible to implement this concept at a much faster pace. With the availability of vast amounts of data and computational power, it has become increasingly feasible. Generative models aim to generate new data resembling the training data distribution by learning its underlying patterns. They capture the inherent complexity of the data to produce outputs similar to the training examples. Discriminative models, on the other hand, focus on learning boundaries between different classes or categories within the data. The maritime industry is a major contributor to the global economy, but it is also a high-risk industry, as it is exposed to a variety of hazards. Generative AI can be used to improve maritime safety and efficiency in several ways. Although the maritime industry is still in the early stages of adopting generative AI, the potential benefits are significant. The integration of generative AI into maritime operations plays an increasingly important role in the maritime industry. In this view, this paper discusses generative AI, its technology, various applications, and key challenges and research prospectives.},

  abstract={Web Scraping involves the use of bots for the purpose of extracting data from the online web. To extract such data, the web scraper must conduct at least 3 different steps, i.e., collect the necessary links from the web, extract data using the provided links, and save the information in a neatly organized CSV file or database. However, traditional methods to accomplish these steps have faced many difficulties, such as anti-scraping measures and website changes. To tackle these difficulties and to accomplish the steps in a more rapid yet advanced way, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be utilized. As of mid-2024, the rapid development and improvement of AI has resulted in its integration into many businesses and educational institutions. The current state of AI is remarkably advanced that it can be integrated in about any field and sector available. In this paper, the researcher defined the term Web Scraping, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, explained the use of AI in Web Scraping including its importance and potential, and the understanding of ethical web scraping practices. This literature review indicated that the integrated use of AI improves the performance of Web Scraping compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract={In the evolving landscape of educational technology, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational assessment creation has emerged as a key area of innovation. This paper compares three methods for generating Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): (1) without the use of generative AI, (2) with unguided usage of ChatGPT, and (3) with a specialized AI-powered micro-app designed specifically for MCQ generation. The micro-app, named the "MCQ Generator", allows users to set preferences such as difficulty level, number of distractors, and inclusion of hints/feedback, tailoring the final prompt based on these selections. Our study involves instructional designers creating MCQs for hypothetical courses, with educators then evaluating the quality of these questions using a rubric-based approach. The results reveal that AI-assisted methods significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of MCQ generation compared to non-AI methods. Notably, the micro-app demonstrates potential advantages over ChatGPT, offering a more user-friendly interface and a lower barrier to entry for educators. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT can enhance the MCQ creation process, AI micro-apps may provide more tailored functionalities that further streamline educators’ workflows. This paper presents empirical evidence on the utility of AI in educational content development. By doing so, it contributes to the broader discourse on the transformative potential of AI in educational assessment, with a particular focus on online education. Additionally, it explores methods to increase AI adoption within the field.},

  abstract={The development of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI tools, has significantly transformed higher education. This study examined the key challenges encountered by college lecturers in the AI environment and the practical solutions they offered for these challenges. Seventeen heads of departments or academic units from a teacher education college participated in this study. Data were collected through a video-recorded focus group interview and supplemented reports. Data were analyzed inductively using the constant comparison method to identify recurring themes and patterns across the participants. The findings revealed five central challenges faced by college lecturers: (1) Assessment integrity that includes difficulties in verifying student authenticity, increasing plagiarism risks, and diminishing academic originality; (2) AI adoption resistance characterized by reluctance or hesitancy in embracing AI technologies stemming from limited familiarity and a lack of confidence; (3) Pedagogical adaptation imperative that necessitates the revision of instructional methodologies and a redefinition of the lecturer's role in the context of AI integration; (4) Technological literacy disparities that refer to gaps in digital literacy among both faculty and students, compound by unequal familiarity with AI tools; and (5) Limited institutional resources that result in restricted access to advanced AI tools and insufficient professional development opportunities. In response to these challenges, the participants proposed several potential solutions: fostering transparent and ethical student utilization of AI tools, implementing alternative assessment strategies focused on personal and critical thinking skills, enhancing institutional support through ICT centers, offering structured training programs, and ensuring equitable access to AI platforms. So, colleges need to open dialogue and collaboration among faculty members to develop shared guidelines and best practices for the ethical and effective use of AI in academic settings. In addition, teaching should focus more on thinking critically and personal skills, which are especially essential in the AI environment.},

  abstract={This paper proposes an adversarial hash cross-modal retrieval method based on a multimodal interactive attention mechanism. By constructing a cross-modal shared subspace representation learning network KGRU, the global semantic and local semantic information of each modality is extracted, and then introduce the attention mechanism into the model to further capture the key local feature information in different modalities. The experimental results show that this method can accurately mine the structural information and semantic correlation between modalities, and improve the accuracy of cross-modal retrieval. Improve computing time efficiency. The state-of-the-art effect is obtained in cross-modal retrieval experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset.},

  abstract={In recent years, research on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has progressed rapidly, making it essential to understand its research trends and developments to drive technological innovation and implementation in the education sector. Through a bibliometric analysis of 2,038 papers retrieved from the Web of Science database, we identified that China, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom are leading in this field. The bibliometric analysis reveals that the primary applications of artificial intelligence technologies in education include deep learning, machine learning, augmented reality, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP). These technologies have been widely applied in various scenarios, such as intelligent tutoring systems, automated grading systems, and educational robots. Notably, generative AI technologies are advancing rapidly, sparking extensive discussions and controversies in education and other societal domains. Looking ahead, the development of education requires further cultivation of AI-driven thinking and the support of relevant policies to promote the deep integration of technology and education.},

  pages={601-606},
  abstract={The increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in learning contexts calls for a reassessment of the complex dynamics surrounding academic integrity. It is a “hot” topic in the academic community, given that these more generative AI tools have become available to students to complete student assignments, and universities have had to urgently adopt rules on their use for academic purposes. While some universities have completely banned the use of such programs for the purpose of writing assignments and essays because they believe that this violates academic integrity, some other universities believe that they have the potential to influence the way we learn and approach education and that generative AI tools they must use for the benefit of students and faculty staff. The aim of the study conducted at the universities of Vern and Algebra in Zagreb, in the winter semester academic year 2023/2024 was to investigate whether students use generative AI tools for writing assignments and academic papers, how they perceive academic integrity in relation to the use of generative AI tools, and the advantages and disadvantages of generative artificial intelligence tools.},

  abstract={Summary <p>There are two broad classes in AI: generative AI and discriminative AI. Machine learning (ML), a part of AI, learns from data. Deep learning (DL), a deeper part of ML, uses layered setups to solve tougher problems. Discriminative AI focuses on algorithms that learn to tell apart different data classes. Looking at existing applications, discriminative AI generally has five main tasks: classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning. Generative AI has the ability to generate all kinds of data and content. By learning the patterns and characteristics of given datasets, generative AI models can create new data samples that are similar to the original data. Generally speaking, generative AI models can perform three tasks: data generation, data transformation, and data enrichment. Large language models are at the forefront of generative AI applications, with widespread impacts across various industries.</p>},
