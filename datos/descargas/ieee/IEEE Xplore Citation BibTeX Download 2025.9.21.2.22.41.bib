  abstract={This study examines how multimedia arts students perceive generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential threat to traditional artistic practices. While AI-powered tools are increasingly integrated into creative processes, offering benefits such as efficiency, expanded techniques, and access to new artistic possibilities, their use has sparked concerns about the declining role of manual skills and the authenticity of AI-generated works. Using Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory as a framework, this research explores student insights through qualitative analysis, including keyword frequency and word cloud visualization. Results indicate a generally positive attitude toward AI’s practical applications, yet students express reservations about its impact on creative identity, originality, and ethical considerations such as copyright and attribution. These findings suggest a need for educational approaches that introduce AI critically and constructively, ensuring that emerging technologies enhance rather than replace human creativity. Future research should explore pedagogical strategies that preserve traditional artistic values while preparing students to navigate an evolving creative landscape.},

  pages={735-739},
  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology, it has been increasingly utilized in the field of education. This paper takes the course of Human Resource Management for medical and health management majors as an example and discusses in some detail the potential and practical effectiveness of generative AI in enhancing the efficiency and quality of teaching in this course. This paper uses the case study method to explore the intelligent generation of knowledge points, personalized learning recommendation system, and intelligent homework correction of generative AI in classroom teaching. In addition, this paper evaluates the teaching effect of generative AI from various aspects, such as students’ learning effectiveness, participation, and satisfaction. Through the collection and analysis of relevant data, it is facilitated that generative AI can effectively improve students’ learning motivation and achievement and strengthen the implementation of classroom interaction and individual teaching. The study shows that generative AI can not only improve the quality and efficiency of teaching, but also continuously optimize teaching strategies through data-driven approaches, creating more value for both teachers and students. The case study found that students 001 and 003 were more engaged, as evidenced by the relatively high number of logins, forum postings, and project submissions, and accordingly, their satisfaction scores were higher, at 4 and 5, respectively. In conclusion, the application of generative AI technology in the teaching of Human Resource Management course for medical and health management majors demonstrates its broad prospect in the field of educational technology.},

  title={Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the Education of Software Verification and Validation}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Since the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), education in computer science has prompted efforts to incorporate it into the educational curriculum. This innovative practice full paper presents a study into using GenAI to enhance student learning of software engineering. It outlines the initiatives to introduce GenAI into a graduate-level software engineering course in Software Verification and Validation (SV&V). The paper presents the educational goals, methodologies and findings of these endeavors in this course. The primary education goal of this course is that students have a solid understanding of principles and practices of software quality assurance and seek to introduce students to diverse techniques employed for SV&V. The study presented in this paper centers on the practical application of GenAI within the domain of testing strategies. The paper introduces the findings of an exercise where GenAI was used to apply testing strategies for unit testing. The exercise consisted of the use of GenAI in the development of unit tests for an algorithm. Rigorous assessments were conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the unit tests developed for validating the accurate implementation of the algorithm. This exploration shed light on the tangible impact of GenAI on the precision and efficiency of unit testing procedures. The findings underscore the significance of encouraging students to actively explore emerging trends and methodologies in the realm of software verification and validation. By incorporating GenAI into the educational framework, students not only gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of this technology but also foster a mindset of continuous learning in software quality assurance. The paper demonstrates that it is not sufficient to use the test cases developed by GenAI for software validation since test cases recommended by GenAI do not cover corner cases which causes gaps in coverage in unit testing. The majority of the students were able to understand the limitation of GenAI in SV&V but appreciated its support in suggesting test cases for the most common cases. This exercise allowed students to enhance their creative problem-solving through human-guided AI partnership which is pivotal in cultivating a new generation of professionals capable of contributing to the ongoing evolution of software quality.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={902-906},
  abstract={Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an agile software development approach. It promotes short cycles, composed of three phases each, to incrementally implement software functionality: Red, Green, and Refactor. In the Red Phase, the TDD developer writes a unit test for a small chunk of functionality not yet implemented and watches the test fail. In the Green Phase, the TDD developer writes production code to make the test pass as quickly as possible. Finally, in the refactor phase, the TDD developer “cleans” written code. In this demo paper, we present GAI4-TDD (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Test-Driven Development), a PyCharm plugin to support the Green Phase of TDD. Specifically, this plugin generates production code from the tests the TDD developer had written in the Red Phase so that the generated code makes these tests pass. Previous studies have shown that TDD can be beneficial not only in the “traditional” software development context but also in the Embedded Systems (ESs) development context. We preliminary assessed GAI4-TDD in the latter context through a laboratory empirical study on three ESs. We observed that in the greater part of the cases, GAI4- TDD generates production code that successfully implements the chunk of functionality required. A video showing GAI4- TDD in action is available at: https://youtu.be/30IDb-6NgS4.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Collective reflection is essential for pre-service science teachers' professional development which involves participants generating multiple ideas for their reflection exercises. However, current research revealed that it is a challenge for facilitating collective reflection due to its superficial cognition and intangible quality. Considering generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has been demonstrated to be able to help promote teachers' professional development in a large amount of existing research, this study integrated the ChatGPT 4.0 into preservice science teachers' collective reflection. Due to the dynamic and complicated process of collective reflection, Epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach was employed to trace the development process of 14 pre-service science teachers' collaborative discourse patterns in two collective reflection activities after micro-teaching and traditional classroom teaching. Data analysis results revealed that when the pre-service science teachers used ChatGPT in collective reflection, they demonstrated less active on providing critical feedback and analyzing the causes of problems combined pedagogical knowledge and classroom observation. Furthermore, the pre-service science teachers had different highlights in two collective reflection activities. Suggestions are provided to promote the pre-service science teachers' integrated GAI collective reflection.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This study examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and the work environment on the motivation of formal workers in DKI Jakarta Province. Using IBM SPSS 29 for data analysis, 402 formal workers participated via online questionnaires. Results indicate that GAI positively correlates with work motivation (regression coefficient=0.71, t = 10.98, p < 0.001). Likewise, a favourable work climate considerably boosts motivation (β = 0.63, t = 12.21, p < 0.001). Also, the work environment was found to have a significant indirect effect on the GAI-motivation relationship (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). The results of this research imply that the implementation of sophisticated AI technologies and a favourable organisational climate are the keys to increasing employees’ effectiveness and engagement. Despite the study’s short data collection period, the results are indicative. Strategic investments in GAI and improvements in the work environment could significantly enhance the motivation of Jakarta’s 3.08 million formal workers. This paper provides valuable insights into leveraging GAI and work environment factors to improve employee well-being in Jakarta’s dynamic work context.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={147-149},
  abstract={Literary studies critically examine fictional texts, exploring their structures, themes, stylistic features, and cultural-historical contexts. A central challenge in this field lies in bridging textual analysis with the spatial and sensory dimensions of settings described or implied in texts. Traditional methodologies often require scholars to mentally reconstruct these environments, leading to incomplete or inconsistent interpretations. Readers may be biased by their personal context or experiences, or may lack detailed knowledge of the relevant historical facts. This paper argues for the integration of virtual reality and generative artificial intelligence as supporting instruments to enhance literary research. The former enables immersive, spatially accurate reconstructions of historical environments, while the latter provides tools such as text-to-image and text-to-3D generation which let us dynamically render visual elements quoted in literary texts. Together, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance traditional literature analysis methodologies, enabling novel approaches for contextualizing and analyzing literature in its spatial and cultural milieu.},

  abstract={In the digitalizing world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) paves the way for the automation of routine work done by humans and makes life easier. Recently, there is no area where AI and its applications are not used in daily life, from health to education, from transportation to energy, and from agriculture to tourism. AI applications are making rapid progress in the direction of important and current developments, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). A concrete example of progress in these areas is the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. AI-assisted GPT-3 technology is the DL model that is effectively used in many NLP fields, which can produce long and consistent content similar to the texts written by people using pre-trained algorithms. The GPT-3 architecture has reached a level that can compete with people in many areas by producing optimum solutions for all kinds of inputs by using the Transformer-based language model, which is an attention-based deep learning technique. This article aims to convey the efficiency, structure and potential of the Transformer-assisted GPT-3 model, which is one of the most up-to-date NLP technologies, to the reader. Since the number of Turkish studies in the field of GPT-3 AI is quite limited, it is considered that this study will contribute to the literature in terms of both quantity and quality. In addition, the performance parameters of the model were examined by making a customized fine-tuned sample application in the beta version of the GPT-3 model.},

  abstract={Multi-agent path planning is one of the most challenging problems in the field of artificial intelligence. In this paper, an improved generative adversarial network model with hybrid attention mechanism for data-driven path planning is proposed. Firstly, by introducing spatial attention mechanism, positional attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism, a hybrid attention module is designed. This module not only establishes feature relationship between different locations, but also provides adaptive feature weights to highlight key information. Next, by embedding the hybrid attention module into the generative adversarial network, an improved generative adversarial network model is developed. The proposed model can capture effective feature information in the image and ensures that the generated path can evade obstacles accurately. Finally, some simulation results are provided to verify the superiority and accuracy of the model in path planning.},

  abstract={The advent of the sixth generation of mobile communications (6G) ushers in an era of heightened demand for advanced network intelligence to tackle the challenges of an expanding network landscape and increasing service demands. Deep Learning (DL), as a crucial technique for instilling intelligence into 6G, has demonstrated powerful and promising development. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the pivotal role of DL in 6G, exploring the myriad opportunities and challenges that arise. Firstly, we present a detailed vision for DL in 6G, emphasizing areas such as adaptive resource allocation, intelligent network management, robust signal processing, ubiquitous edge intelligence, and endogenous security. Secondly, this paper reviews how DL models leverage their unique learning capabilities to solve complex service demands in 6G. The models discussed include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Transformer, Federated Learning (FL), and Meta Learning. Additionally, we examine the specific challenges each DL model faces within the 6G context. Moreover, we delve into the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), examining its development and impact within the 6G framework. Finally, this paper culminates in a detailed discussion of ten critical open problems in integrating DL with 6G, setting the stage for future research and development in this field.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In the world of artificial intelligence (AI), data acts as the vital force driving machine learning algorithms. Data lays the foundation for the construction of AI systems, and readers need a sufficient quality and quantity of data to make sure that their AI programs perform successfully. Data is the fuel that trains the AI to discern patterns and interpret the inputs provided. Generative AI's ability to automatically read unstructured data and classify it appropriately for future uses is an immensely powerful capability for companies. This chapter explores the importance of data and its collection, storage, and management. The success of using AI to propel marketing and business results directly depends on the quality of data that fuels the AI engines. Machine learning models require a sufficient amount of data to discern patterns and make accurate predictions. Data splitting is the process of dividing the data set into training, validation, and test sets.</p>},

  abstract={Deep learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has grown quickly and is now widely used in computer software. As the need for deep learning algorithms that can handle more complicated tasks keeps growing very quickly, the improvements in how efficient and productive these algorithms can be utilized for identifying data poisoning is an important step. Data poisoning refers to altering the legitimate data using various techniques and fabricating the expected results. The poisoning will affect the quality of predictions and reliability of the contents generated. The data sensitive applications which rely on classification models for deriving conclusions will be affected by poisoning resulting in unrealistic conclusions and misguided inferences. Continuous occurrence of poorly classified data and unrealistic conclusions will affect the reliability of the system making it less trustworthy. This research looks into long lasting effects of poisoning attacks, which target the training data used in deep learning and assess the way a deep learning model classifies information. Experiments were done to measure the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in effectively detecting poisoned data. The evaluations were done using KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models. The analysis concludes that KNN offers better prediction compared to SVM and Logistic Regression. Logistic regression offers less accurate predictions making it unfit for poisoning detection. Proper classification of poisoned data will help research community and users to be aware of legitimacy of data and thereby help them to choose the right data and information for processing, analytics, and deriving conclusions. This will greatly improve the performance and trustworthiness of related models including generative AI systems and makes the learning process un biased which will highly benefit the research community in general.},

  title={Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for Arabic Calligraphy}, 
  year={2021},

  pages={652-657},
  abstract={Arabic calligraphy is one of the most aesthetic art forms in the world due to its variety and long history. However, generating calligraphic style is mainly done by human expert calligrapher (also known as Khattat) and has not been carried out by machine learning techniques. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are deep learning tools that achieved outstanding results in the field of style transfer and generation. In this paper, various GAN architectures were investigated such as CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) within Arabic calligraphy in two aspects: generation and style transfer. The results show that CycleGAN can transfer skeleton letters to both Naskh and Thulth styles, Pix2Pix can denoise the calligraphy papers, and DCGAN can generate realistic Arabic calligraphy letters. The proposed approaches are applicable for other calligraphy styles besides Naskh and Thulth. Finally, the models are evaluated qualitatively using a preference judgment technique survey.},

  abstract={The rapid rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging capabilities has spurred public curiosity to evaluate and compare different LLMs, leading many researchers to propose their own LLM benchmarks. Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs’ complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems’ integration into society.},

  abstract={This paper deals with data pseudonymization when using generative artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT. The aim of the research was to experimentally verify whether ChatGPT can maintain the protection of pseudonymized data by not maintaining the link between the anonymized part and personal data. Four requests were tested in the experiment, in which ChatGPT was gradually provided with various combinations of pseudonymized and complete data about customers and their orders. The results showed that ChatGPT does not store previous inputs and is not able to reconstruct personal data retroactively if they were not explicitly provided to it in each request. Based on the results obtained, it can be assumed that the use of ChatGPT when processing pseudonymized data does not pose a risk of violating the protection of personal data. This research seeks to contribute to the discussion on the security of generative artificial intelligence in processing sensitive data and confirms the effectiveness of pseudonymization as a mechanism for protecting personal data.},

  abstract={Medical curricula are based on both theorical knowledge and competence achievement for either postgraduate or undergraduate medical education. It is important that medical students can self-assess their knowledge and competence so that they can take responsibility for their learning quality. Self-assessment is an important parameter in medical education to develop clinical competence.In this article we present a Generative ΑΙ-based Cognitive Robot developed for enabling the automatic self-assessment of hypertension exam candidates’ knowledge.The candidates are provided with ten direct open-questions automatically generated by the Artificial Intelligence solution (i.e., the Cognitive Robot): the performance of the Cognitive Robot is evaluated by comparing the outcomes calculated by the AI solution and the results achieved by the students while answering to the same list of questions, asked by a human Investigator.The Cognitive Robot has proven to present a very high level of accuracy. Moreover, the candidates involved in this study have confirmed the usefulness and trust of the Cognitive Robot. The Artificial Intelligence solution proposed for self-assessing the exam candidates’ knowledge is effective, innovative, accurate and can be extended to other field of study in the medicine realm.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={149192-149205},
  abstract={In the context of the swift advancement and integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into the design realm, comprehending user acceptance of these advanced tools has emerged as a pivotal issue. The primary purpose of this research is to examine and understand the factors influencing user acceptance and behavioral intentions towards generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the design field. To achieve this, this research delineates a multifaceted theoretical model, underpinned by an analysis of user behavioral intentions and their driving factors. The model encapsulates eight principal constructs: intention to continue use, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, facilitating conditions, expectation confirmation, trust in technology, and social influence. An empirical examination of 13 related hypotheses was conducted. Utilizing data from 339 valid questionnaires, the outcomes of the structural equation modeling lent support to all posited hypotheses. The research delineates that users’ sustained intention to utilize generative AI technology is directly contingent upon factors such as perceived usefulness, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and trust in technology. Notably, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are identified as pivotal determinants of satisfaction. Furthermore, social influence and expectation confirmation are found to augment perceived usefulness, while facilitating conditions to enhance both self-efficacy and expectation confirmation. These findings yield novel insights into the theory of user behavior, charting a course for the refinement of generative AI design tools. Such enhancements are aimed at fostering a more extensive application and acceptance of these tools in the relevant fields.},
