  abstract={In the era of digital intelligence, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into educational practices has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods. Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.},

  abstract={The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought ethical issues into sharp focus, affecting generative AI, predictive AI, robotics and autonomous devices, and more. In this paper, we examine AI ethical questions from the perspective of Catholic Social Teaching (CST), a framework with philosophical and theological foundations, governing interpersonal interactions and those with the natural world. CST offers a coherent, integrated, and non-utilitarian vision of social ethics, grounded in human dignity and the objective demands of justice and the common good. Other ethical approaches may fragment or relativize these principles, or lack an ultimate grounding for them. Thus, CST has the potential to make a contribution to AI ethics.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={445-449},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as "hallucinations"—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the ethical and practical implications of AI in education, providing valuable insights into best practices for integrating AI technologies to enhance learning while upholding academic integrity.},

  abstract={Over the past few decades, immersive technologies have completely transformed the world around us. Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.},

  abstract={Computer science has recently experienced a surge in popularity with the release of generative artificial intelligence models. Yet, while the popular imagination has been captured, evidence indicates that pre-college students, especially those from underrepresented populations, lack adequate education about careers in the field. Effective methods for gaining understanding include shadowing professionals or acquiring internships, yet these means are often not attainable or realistic for many students. Overall, this insufficient education can lead to future disadvantages, including future workforce disparities. To address these problems, Computer Science Next (CSNext) is an organization that was founded in early 2024 to convey insights from the current to the next generation of computer scientists. CSNext's first project will be a series of video interviews with leaders in artificial intelligence intended for a high school student audience. Video interviews will be released for free, and responses will be synthesized to share meaningful and insightful commonalities and responses. In addition, a list of the resources discussed in the interview will be cataloged alongside the videos and indexed for the site in its entirety. Particular attention will be focused on inclusivity, including underrepresented minorities, when selecting interview candidates.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are cutting edge technologies, in the field of AI. This study presents an architectural framework that combines these technologies to improve decision making in systems. Through case studies we explore how integrating AI with RL enhances performance in real world applications. By incorporating RL strategies, our approach ensures parameter settings and successful operation of the AI model leading to results. This framework can be applied in multiple software applications like information synthesis and creative simulation. Despite challenges like training instability and limited resources that generative models face, our research recognises the potential that this approach can effectively addess these issues. Our innovative framework uses RL techniques to improve the models performance during training. The results suggest that combining RL with AI not overcomes existing limitations but also opens up possibilities, for data driven applications. This hybrid method pushes the boundaries of models offering solutions across different fields.},

  abstract={Generative AI is gaining attention in educational settings to enhance teaching and learning activities. However, to date, an account of students' perceptions and preferences in generative artificial intelligence, from the Philippines, a higher education institution. The study was designed through an experimental approach by involving students enrolled in a programming course. Each programming assessment task was provided feedback through chatGPT and student perceptions and preferences were collected using a survey, analyzed using descriptive and thematic analysis. Results show that students prefer chatGPT generated feedback based on specificity, clarity, objectivity, and corrective guidance to enhance the codes. Further, students suggest that best practices in coding complying with industry standards and efficiency of the code should be considered in providing formative feedback. Further, making the students more confident and independent in problem-solving skills. Overall, the study indicates the potential of chatGPT generated formative feedback to enhance attainment of the learning outcomes in programming courses.},

  abstract={This paper discusses generative pre-trained transformer technology and its intersection with forms of creativity and law. It highlights the potential of generative AI to change considerable elements of society, including modes of creative endeavors, problem-solving, employment, education, justice, medicine, and governance. The author emphasizes the need for policymakers and experts to join in regulating against the potential risks and implications of this technology. The European Commission has taken steps to address the risks of AI through the European AI Act (EIA), which categorizes AI uses based on their potential harm. The legislation aims to ensure scrutiny and control in extreme cases like autonomous weapons or medical devices. However, the author criticizes the lack of meaningful AI oversight in the United States and argues that time has come for government to step in and offer meaningful regulation given the technology’s (1) rate of diffusion (2) virtually uncountable product permutations, the purposes, extent and depths to which it is anticipated to penetrate institutional and daily life.},

  abstract={The near field scanning method specified in the international standard IEC-61967 is an important international diagnostic method for detecting electromagnetic compatibility problems. The near-field probe, as an important part of near-field scanning, mainly detects the magnetic field or electric field. The measurement accuracy of the near field probe directly affects the measurement accuracy of the electromagnetic field on the surface of the device, affecting the accuracy of electromagnetic compatibility diagnostics. To ensure measurement accuracy, it is essential to carry out near-field probe calibration. In this work, we proposed an artificial intelligence probe calibration method based on the generative adversarial networks, which helps improve the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field and eliminate the unnecessary influence field on the probe performance. Based on the proposed method, we effectively calibrate two kinds of electric field probes, which overcomes the problem of the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field, and eliminate the influence of unnecessary field to the probe performance.},
