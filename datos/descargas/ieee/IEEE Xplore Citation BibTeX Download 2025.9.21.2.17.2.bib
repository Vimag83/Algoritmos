  abstract={This research explores the transformative role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAl) for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) software developers. KSA is transforming from an oil-dependent economy to a diversified one to achieve Vision 2030. Technological advancement is among the strategic objectives of the Kingdom, facilitating the achievement of the ambitious vision. GenAl's ability to undertake tasks like code generation, debugging, and documentation may threaten developers whose jobs could be replaced. However, instead of replacing software engineers, GenAl will create more opportunities for programmers, increase the demand for more experienced developers, and evolve the role of software engineers. While the benefits of GenAl in software engineering are immense, the Kingdom should address the ethical challenges, inadequate transparency, accountability problems, and data privacy issues. This paper recommends the establishment of a National AI Ethics Board, the government to mandate explainable AI (XAI), investments in more localised models like the Arabic Large Language Model (ALLaM), extensive training for GenAl engineers, cross-sector collaboration, and continuous monitoring.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The pervasive spread of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has borne increasing security risk, with static defense falling to dynamic, smart attacks. The Hybrid Adaptive AI Security Framework (HAASF), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and swarm intelligence (SI) to provide strong, adaptive security for IoT ecosystems, is what this paper offers. HAASF employs a DQN-based RL defender to acquire dynamic defense prioritization, GANs for strong proactive learning through realistic attack model generation, and PSO-induced SI for IoT node distributed threat mitigation. Evaluated on an NS-3 simulated testbed smart home with 50 devices of diverse hardware, HAASF was compared with five types of attacks, i.e., DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Sybil, Data Tampering, and Replay attacks. Against baselines—single RL, signature-based IDS, and CNN-based anomaly detection—HAASF achieved a 95% detection rate, 4% false positive rate, 1.9-second response time, and 40 mW energy consumption. These are HAASF's capabilities in new threat detection, predicting attack patterns, and resource optimization combined against traditional IoT defenses. Through the combination of hybrid AI approaches, HAASF offers scalable, energy-efficient, and responsive security upon which scalable IoT systems can be based in increasingly interconnected and vulnerable systems.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the interaction of non-expert stakeholders with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the energy urban domain, using the VIRTSI model and focusing on the capabilities of ChatGPT. VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent systems), is a rigorous computational model for human-AI Interaction that simulates human trust states, spanning from overtrust to distrust, through user modelling and quantifies the efficiency of the interaction in VIRTSI-adapted confusion matrices. The research employed an 16-question survey, evaluating the accuracy and usefulness of ChatGPT's responses regarding energy consumption, cost-effective solutions, and renewable energy production for residential buildings in Greece. Each answer was assessed by human stakeholders who were non-expert in the energy Urban Domain (e.g house owners, building managers, etc.), who either accepted or rejected the responses based on validation processes. The analysis highlighted key aspects such as repetition, specification, and objections in the interaction with ChatGPT, offering insights into the effectiveness of AI in supporting energy-related decisions. The findings reveal that while AI can provide valuable information, user validation and expert consultation are critical for practical implementation. This highlights both the potential and limitations of integrating AI tools like ChatGPT in enhancing non-expert stakeholder engagement and decision-making in urban energy management, emphasizing the ongoing need for human expert involvement.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) image generation techniques have proved to be potential techniques in the development of the digital creative product design. However, integrating digital culture with modernity while classifying AI image generation technology was a major concern. In this research, the hyper parameter tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Stochastic Gradient (DCNN-SGD) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks, by classifying $A I$ images of product design. The open source AI images are collected and pre-processed to achieve noise free images by applying Gaussian filter. The pre-processed images are then fed to the CNN to extract features. The creative product design process is analysed which includes research and analysis, design expression and the final evaluation. The DCNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers are used for the classification and identification of cultural symbols. For the effective identification of cultural heritage, the hyperparameters of the DCNN are finetuned with SGD. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN-SGD achieved better performance with classification accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \%}$, precision of $\mathbf{9 5. 7 7 \%}$, and recall of $94.26 \%$ when compared to the existing methods improved Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).},

This is a serious issue due to the numerous deaths every year due to events caused directly by excess rainfall. While weather forecasting has advanced significantly throughout the years there is still significant room for improvement. One of the main factors detrimental to accurate weather prediction is the multitude of variables required to achieve accurate prediction. Our research seeks to use publicly available satellite imagery to achieve accurate prediction of rainfall with relatively little input data. We seek to achieve that goal by using a custom generative modelling approach to make predictions.},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem of uncivilized speech on campus, a detection method combining semi-supervised generative adversarial network and self-attention mechanism is proposed. The algorithm can use most of the unlabeled samples and a small part of the labeled samples to realize the abnormal detection of uncivilized speech, which solves the problems that the experimental samples are not easy to obtain and the cost of marking is high. In order to make full use of the latent representation learned by the encoder module in the auto-encoder, a new representation term is added to the anomaly score function part; in order to improve the problem of the traditional convolution local receptive field, a self-attention mechanism is introduced into the generative adversarial network Modules that help models learn long-range dependency representations of data. Experiments on self-made datasets show that the method proposed in this paper can improve the ability of model anomaly detection and improve the accuracy of anomaly detection.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of education due to its rapid expansion in educational technology by introducing personalized and efficient learning experiences. Several artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being integrated into this research project such as “Coursera Coach powered by Generative AI” which incorporates adaptive learning, “AI- assisted course building powered by Generative AI” which incorporates intelligent tutoring elements and “Turnitin” offers tools for grading and providing feedback to revolutionize teaching, learning, and assessment practices in higher education. Researchers evaluate the effectiveness of AI tools in enhancing student engagement, personalizing learning experiences, and optimizing assessment processes based on a variety of quantitative metrics. A comparison is made between experimental groups that follow AI-integrated teaching methods and control groups that follow a traditional approach to instruction. As part of the study, scores of pre- and post-assessment questions were collected, learning progression patterns were analyzed, and instructors and students provided qualitative feedback. As a result of the experimental data, it has been possible to discern which AI tools have strengths and limitations within the context of higher education. A variety of adaptive learning platforms are evaluated for their ability to adjust content to individual learning styles, while intelligent tutoring systems are assessed for their impact on comprehension, retention, and problem-solving skills. Automated grading tools are tested for their efficiency gains in assessment processes and their ability to improve feedback promptness and quality. A substantial amount of empirical evidence is provided by the findings of this study to the ongoing discourse on AI integration in higher education. This study provides a wealth of actionable insights for academic staff, technicians, and administrators seeking evidence-based strategies for implementing AI technologies in their educational frameworks.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is concerned with creating new data&#x2014;such as text, pictures, videos&#x2014;based on preexisting data. It involves devices and algorithms that learn from the massive volume of data they are provided, enabling them to continuously get better. Generative AI was initially made popular by ChatGPT, an AI chatbot. Apple plans to introduce an AI&#x2010;powered coding assistant in Xcode, thereby entering the AI&#x2010;assisted coding space and taking aim at Microsoft's GitHub Copilot. AI presents itself as a game&#x2010;changer for optimizing supply chain processes and to boost productivity. Specifically, AI can assist the supply chain challenges for business by doing the following: predictive analytics, optimization, automation, and real&#x2010;time visibility. This chapter explores some practical applications of AI in supply chain management for achieving business scalability: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, supplier management, and warehouse automation.</p>},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence, bringing sophisticated AI capabilities into daily life and work. As we approach the era of Hyper Intelligence (Hyper-I), a variety of critical challenges and emerging issues have come to light, ranging from computational complexity to ethical concerns. This paper explores the evolution of AI from the perspective of human learning, comparing machine and human intelligence, and identifying key considerations for the development of future AI systems. It also highlights the growing importance of regulating advanced AI models, such as Reinforcement Learning-based Long-Term Planning Agents, to ensure that Hyper-I remains under human control. Additionally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of transformer-based models, their applicability to intractable problems, and their role in cognitive building systems and resource-constrained environments through TinyML. By analyzing these pressing challenges, this work provides insights into the future of AI and the path toward responsible innovation in generative and hyper-intelligent systems.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used by professionals and students to support creative tasks, raising ethical concerns about originality, and transparency. In this paper, we examine the interaction between developers of GAI models and design students, focusing on the nexus between ethics and functionality. Using a design class example, we show how GAI models can help students efficiently and responsibly explore design alternatives by quantitatively assessing their designs' novelty relative to the training data. Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models. By addressing these considerations, we aim to promote the responsible use of GAI in design education and beyond.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies are starting to be adopted in the industrial world in many different contexts and sectors, from health care to the automotive, from agriculture to the industrial. As such applications operate in sensitive contexts, it is natural to question: Are they cyber-secure? Can attackers exploit AI applications for their attack? In this work, we discuss the Achilles heel of artificial intelligence: the “adversarial machine learning.” From a cybersecurity practitioner’s point of view, we discuss threats related to AI applications that include each component involved in the AI process, from the operative systems and libraries utilized to deploy the AI application, to the actual AI lifecycle.},

  abstract={Personality recognition from textual data plays a crucial role in various applications such as social media analysis, recommendation systems, and personalized marketing. In this study, we propose an effective personality recognition model leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence based Learning Principles (GAILP), which combines DenseNet feature extraction from user profile images with text-based features extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and NLTK. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing self-reported MBTI types and associated textual data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAILP model, achieving an accuracy of over 97% in personality recognition tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating visual and textual cues for accurate personality recognition and underscore the potential of GAILP-based approaches in this domain.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes gaps in key safety issues for U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international approvals of artificial intelligence/machine learning-enabled medical devices (AIMD). National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidance for patient safety and AIMD security. For example, NIST Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-82r3, and NIST SP 1500-202, Section 2.3.3, suggest approximate patient safety analysis approaches. Related NIST security issues are identified in NIST guidance for artificial intelligence/machine learning risk management, such as NIST's adversarial machine learning guidance. An analytical literature review was conducted within the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries Catalyst databases to support stated objectives around selected NIST common language terms related to safety and security. The resulting analysis demonstrates that, in the U.S. and on an international scale, selected AIMD literature and guidance may not include or consistently use critical, integrated terms for AIMD security or safety, such as NISTIR 8312's four principles of artificial intelligence explainability. In conclusion, AIMD safety and security could be addressed with NIST common languages.},
