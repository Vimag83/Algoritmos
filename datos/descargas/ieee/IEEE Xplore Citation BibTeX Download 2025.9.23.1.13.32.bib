  abstract={As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.},

  abstract={There are many researches on noise suppression of traditional noise suppression algorithms, and the suppression effect has reached the bottleneck. Now the widely studied artificial intelligence algorithm provides a new idea for very low frequency (VLF) communication noise reduction in ocean navigation. The generative adversarial network is introduced into the noise interference suppression algorithm.Based on the improved generative adversarial network model, the VLF noise interference suppression algorithm is studied. The generation model with strong learning ability is used to improve the accuracy of expected signal frequency estimation in the spectrum of noisy signal, and further improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in the signal bandwidth. The experimental results show that, by training the generative adversarial network, the received signals in the direction of - 45° to 45° of the receiving antenna show good noise reduction effect, and the accuracy rate can reach above 90%.},

  abstract={Research on utilization of artificial intelligence in higher education has significantly expanded in recent years. However, the existing literature in this domain highlights a shortage of research in specific subareas, such as ChatGPT and the innovative utilization of advanced artificial intelligence tools. With the growing number of studies focusing on artificial intelligence in higher education, there is a need to assess to what extent the current body of research is filling the previously reported research gap. This study aims to review research published within the last 11 months in the year 2023, to assess the status and direction of recent publications in these specific areas and to provide a comprehensive summary that will assist scholars and higher education institutions in shaping their future work on artificial intelligence in higher education. Using a systematic literature review methodology, 295 articles published on the Scopus database were analyzed. The review findings indicate that the majority of papers serve a general overview purpose, with a moderate focus on generative AI, advanced integration of AI into teaching and learning, and prediction modes. On the contrary, a limited number of papers were directed toward AI for assessment, AI Chatbot, and support for administrative processes. These findings highlight the need for a shift of research efforts from more general exploration topics to a more advanced investigation into the usage of AI tools in a novel and sophisticated manner.},

  abstract={Traditionally, ideating new product innovations is primarily the responsibility of marketers, engineers, and designers. However, a rapidly growing interest lies in leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to brainstorm new product and service ideas. This study conducts a comparative analysis of ideas generated by human professionals and an AI system. The results of a blind expert evaluation show that AI-generated ideas score significantly higher in novelty and customer benefit, while their feasibility scores are similar to those of human ideas. Overall, AI-generated ideas comprise the majority of the top-performing ideas, while human-generated ideas scored lower than expected. The executive's emotional and cognitive reactions were measured during the evaluation to check for potential biases and showed no differences between the idea groups. These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, companies can benefit from integrating generative AI into their traditional idea-generation processes.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years and has significantly impacted various domains, including cultural heritage. Indeed, AI technologies offer unprecedented capacities to analyze huge amounts of historical data, enabling researchers and art historians to uncover precious patterns, connections, and insights that might otherwise remain elusive. Also, the efficiency and accuracy of AI techniques play a pivotal role in many cultural heritage-related tasks, such as cataloging and organizing extensive cultural collections, streamlining the management of heritage resources for present and future generations. However, the integration of AI in cultural heritage also brings forth intricate ethical questions. These span over the issues of authenticity, subjectivity, and interpretation biases of an AI-empowered, reproduced, and/or generated artwork up to the legal concerns related to authorship. However, such issues are mostly undefined and unaddressed in the scholarship at the intersection on AI, ethics, and cultural heritage. This paper aims to pave the way to fill such a gap of context-sensitive ethical issues for AI in cultural heritage. To this aim, the paper first analyzes the main opportunities and benefits raised by AI in cultural heritage. Then, matching benchmark, agreed-upon AI ethics principles elaborated in the AI ethics scholarship in the last decade and relevant to cultural heritage, it highlights specific ethical risks that ought to be considered for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI in and for cultural heritage. Finally, areas requiring further attention and work, and actors call to intervene, are identified to facilitate next steps for ethics and governance of AI in cultural heritage.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about a significant revolution in image processing. This revolutionary technology has enabled the analysis, recognition, and interpretation of images in ways that were previously inconceivable. An investigation into the most recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques that have improved the efficiency and precision of image processing tasks is presented in this study. We survey the emergence of transformer architectures and the integration of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to explore how these technologies have transformed the understanding and application of images in several industries. An overview of existing image processing methods and the limits of those approaches is presented at the beginning of our research. This highlights the necessity of more advanced AI-driven solutions. After that, we examine the advancements that have been made in artificial intelligence, such as the incorporation of attention processes, the development of more effective CNN architectures, and the utilisation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the purpose of picture synthesis and augmentation. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact that artificial intelligence has on particular applications of image processing, such as autonomous car navigation systems, facial recognition, medical imaging, and satellite images analysis. Specifically, we focus on the enhancements in diagnostic accuracy, environmental monitoring, security, and safety that arose as a result of the adoption of artificial intelligence in these sectors through the use of case studies. Furthermore, we discuss the issues that are associated with artificial intelligence in image processing. These challenges include the necessity for explainable AI models, the requirement for computational resources, and the protection of data privacy. A number of potential solutions to these problems are proposed by us, including federated learning and the creation of artificial intelligence systems that are more open to scrutiny. Lastly, we come to a conclusion by predicting future developments in artificial intelligence for image processing. These developments include the ability of AI to offer more personalised and adaptable image processing solutions, as well as the integration of AI with edge computing for real-time image analysis. The results of our research highlight the significant role that artificial intelligence plays in the development of image processing skills, which has far-reaching ramifications for the fields of technology, industry, and society.},

  abstract={The development and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought numerous problems and potential threats, such as information cocoons, algorithmic collusion, algorithmic bias and privacy, issues. To combat these issues, governments all over the world, international organizations and giant tech companies all have taken actions and reached an agreement that AI should be trusted. However, there is no uniform definition on trusted AI. In the paper, we make a survey on related works on artificial intelligence principles and ethical guidelines. Then analyze the ethical foundations of trusted AI and give a definition on trusted AI. We propose specific requirements of trusted AI from a technical perspective and give explanations on these technique requirements. Finally, best practices are recommended to achieve trusted AI and promote the responsible use of AI.},

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are machine learning methods that are used in many important and novel applications. For example, in imaging science, GANs are effectively utilized in generating image datasets, photographs of human faces, image and video captioning, image-to-image translation, text-to-image translation, video prediction, and 3D object generation to name a few. In this paper, we discuss how GANs can be used to create an artificial world. More specifically, we discuss how GANs help to describe an image utilizing image/video captioning methods and how to translate the image to a new image using image-to-image translation frameworks in a theme we desire. We articulate how GANs impact creating a customized world.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) could turn brainstorming sessions into a wild ride of endless ideas, design personalized virtual experiences, and maybe even help us write that novel we've been dreaming about. So far, GenAI enables us to automate and augment cognitive and creative jobs, including the work of doctors, designers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as building, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of GenAI transformation. But combine GenAI with robots and that may change. GenAI can help us tackle some of the biggest problems on the planet. Yes, GenAI can be used to draft a funny speech for our friend's wedding, or come up with an idea for tonight's supper. But it can also be used to address issues like climate change, massive inequality, hunger, access to healthcare, and more. It can help us find new treatments for diseases.</p>},
