  abstract={Data-driven application deployment imposes needs for distributed cloud databases that need to handle extensive data quantities efficiently as they provide guarantee and scaling properties and operational performance. Distributed databases now benefit from advanced capabilities enabled by AI systems that promote better database operation and scalability capacity. This research explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence systems with distributed cloud databases to solve database query optimization challenges while managing operational workloads and making fault predictions and ensuring data consistency initiatives. Through our research on generative AI's predictive functions and generative capabilities we formulate innovative techniques that connect automated schema design and adaptive indexing with intelligent data partitioning approaches. Generative AI reveals new capabilities in anomaly prevention that escalate system dependability and slash operational interruptions. The framework implements reinforcement learning and transformers to acquire performance database data which subsequently exploits this information to generate outcomes that coincide with adjusting workload patterns. Experimental results beyond cloud database benchmark testing validate higher query execution performance together with strengthened system resource capacity and accelerated performance. The research incorporates ethical considerations along with privacy analysis while making key points to determine suitable AI deployment in cloud environments. Research demonstrates that generative AI changes distributed cloud database procedures by enabling scalable efficient intelligent operational database management systems. This research enhances understanding of AI applications in cloud computing yet serves as a reference for future domain evolution.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G demonstrates a transformative leap in redefining network efficiency, intelligence, and adaptability. However, AI largely leverages discriminative models relying on labelled and quality data, where data accessibility remains serious concern. Generative AI (GenAI) has gained traction due to its immense potential in resolving the issue of data scarcity, complexity, and incompleteness. GenAI models excel in understanding underlying data distributions, enabling them to generate synthetic data that mirrors real-world patterns. GenAI supports adaptive learning and scenario modeling, making it indispensable for addressing the unpredictability and complexity inherent in 6G networks. Since the complexity of wireless communication systems is increasing and the demand for such systems is growing, GenAI presents new ideas for enhancing network performance, increasing system efficiency, and developing intelligent decision-making capabilities. This survey paper investigates the promising role of GenAI in the evolution of 6G networks. An in-depth discussion of notable GenAI models is presented, outlining their application in enhancing key network components. Specifically, the application of GenAI in advanced technologies including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), digital twins (DTs), and integrated sensing and communications (ISACs) is thoroughly investigated with respect to optimize the adaptability, flexibility, and robustness of the wireless networks. Moreover, use cases of GenAI-enabled wireless networks are presented to highlight the realization of GenAI in 6G. The paper also presents the lessons learned, existing challenges, and future research directions. This paper systematically explores GenAI and its pivotal role in the development of 6G, providing a foundation for researchers to further investigate and advance GenAI-enabled 6G.},

  abstract={Consumer electronic devices are popular in human’s everyday use, and cover a wide range of devices and services. Consumer electronics like smartphone and tablet use digital technologies to enhance human’s entertainment and health. The creation of digital content or data augmentation sometimes requires using generative artificial intelligence technologies. Although data generation systems have been successfully used in some consumer products, it is still challenging to create a powerful generative system due to the complexity of input signals and the difficulty of model training. In this paper, a multistage evolutionary generative adversarial network (GAN) framework is proposed to alleviate the above challenges. The multistage evolutionary GAN is a general framework and can be instantiated to existing evolutionary GAN and its variants. Moreover, this paper designs a two-stage and a three-stage evolutionary GAN methods. The two models show that different variation operators and evaluation methods can be used in different stages. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in capturing complex input signals and alleviating the model training problem. The proposed methods can greatly facilitate the application of image generation systems in consumer products.},

  abstract={We live in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which permeates all aspects of our lives, from spam filtering to image classification on social media. While it is already well-established in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to the IT field, its impact on the design professions remains relatively unexplored. This essay explores the use of neural networks in architecture, which is arguably the first genuinely 21st-century design technique and discusses experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate unexplored futuristic possible noble forms in architecture. In this way this paper also raises the question if machine can generate noble forms through its creative data optimization process. In this process one of the most famous heritages building of Bangladesh 60 dome mosque (Shat Gombuj Moshjid) has been examined to get expected result. Furthermore, this paper discusses how AI can be used as a personalized tool for architects to generate and express design ideas. It evaluates popular datasets for architectural purposes and considers the potential outcomes of experiments. The input of AI in the design process could usher in a new era of architectural design. As data continues to grow, it is shaping our collective future. Therefore, this paper concludes that it is essential to prepare our trained datasets to accept the future which might open up an extraordinary new chapter in the architectural realm.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, distinctions between science fiction and reality are becoming increasingly hazy. Imagine a future where a person’s spirit lives on beyond death, where we can still connect with our loved ones through digital platforms even after they pass away. The notion of maintaining awareness within a digital realm, sparked by the imaginative depiction in the 2014 motion picture Transcendence, is no longer confined to science fiction. We are about to witness a technological advance that will change the game: the ability to create digital replicas that are intricate imprints of our true nature rather than merely simulations.},

  abstract={English writing is a big challenge for the English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners due to the lack the lexical resources to inspire them for writing. However, we developed the mobile app, namely Smart UEnglish with the smart mechanisms by integrating multiple recognition technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to help learners practice meaningful English writing in authentic contexts. Through the smart mechanisms like the integration of speech-to-text (STR), image-to-text recognition (ITR), and generative-AI, the learners could receive not only lexical resources but also sample sentences generated by AI (AI-GS) to inspire them to make meaningful writing. A total of 71 undergraduate students from two classes were assigned to two groups. The experimental group (EG) learns with Smart UEnglish including ITR, STR, and AI-GS. Meanwhile, the control group (CG) learns with ITR and STR only. The mix-method was used to analyze the study deeply. The results found that the EG outperformed the CG in the posttest. The ITR-generated texts as input for AI-GS could inspire the learners by giving the sample sentences before they write the essay. The use of ITR is the predictive variable in the post-test. In addition, the learners in EG have high positive perceptions towards Smart UEnglish. Hence, the integration of multiple recognition technologies and AI in the Smart UEnglish could facilitate EFL learners to learn meaningful writing in authentic contexts.},
