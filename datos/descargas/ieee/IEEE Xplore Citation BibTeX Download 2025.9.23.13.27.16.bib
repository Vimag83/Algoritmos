  abstract={In the presence of renewable resources, such as solar and wind, which are inherently intermittent, battery energy storage systems (BESS) are among the most popular energy storage solutions for increasing grid reliability and stability. Despite all the advantages, energy storage operations can be challenging, from monitoring the output of renewable energy sources to scheduling charging and discharging. The primary aim of this study is to predict renewable energy generation and energy consumption with the highest possible accuracy using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the optimal management of BESS. Specifically, the long-term short-term memory model (LSTM) is used. Then, OpenAI ChatGPT will be applied to support the prediction results and determine the optimal charging and discharging strategies. The advantages and challenges of using ChatGPT and other AI prediction techniques are also discussed. The results showed that among the different generative AI, GPT-3.5 achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.225, mean squared error (MSE) of 46.196, and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.797, demonstrating significant improvements over the basic hyperparametric tuning of the LSTM technique.},

  abstract={This study is dedicated to exploring the application potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AIGC) in non-linear learning, aiming to construct innovative agent models that optimize learning experiences and adapt to the complexity and individual differences in learning. The theory of non-linear learning emphasizes dynamic essence and personalized needs, with AIGC technology providing technical support through its content generation and data analysis capabilities. In terms of model construction, this study designs three core learning paradigms: self-directed, hybrid, and collaborative learning, constructing a diversified non-linear learning ecosystem. The self-directed paradigm realizes personalized learning support, the hybrid paradigm promotes the integration of online and offline learning, and the collaborative paradigm enhances team collaboration and knowledge construction quality. In terms of model implementation, a reinforcement learning framework is adopted to construct a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, introducing personalized dynamic learning paths. By improving the Q-Learning algorithm, intelligent learning paths are generated to achieve deep knowledge correlation learning.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence encapsulates a "black box" of undiscovered knowledge, propelling the exploration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in generative data synthesis and deep learning. Focused on unveiling these "black box" areas, pointed into interpretability and validation in synthetic data generation, shedding light on the intricacies of generative processes. XAI techniques illuminate decision-making in complex algorithms, enhancing transparency and fostering a comprehensive understanding of non-linear relationships. Addressing the complexity of explaining deep learning models, this paper proposes an XAI solution for deep synthetic data generation explanation.

  abstract={As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.},

  abstract={An antenna inverse design scheme based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed. The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including large language and image models, have created new opportunities for pervasive computing education. How do we integrate emerging AI models and tools into our courses in a way that fosters critical engagement? How do we teach students to use AI models and tools responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically, while being aware of their capabilities and limitations? In this article, we share insights from integrating generative AI tools and machine learning (ML) models into a project-based undergraduate tangible and embodied interaction (TEI) course by employing co-creation processes. TEI is an evolving area within human–computer interaction, which focuses on integrating computation into our daily physical environments and objects, thus fostering an embodied, multisensory, and often collaborative interaction experience. We use the term co-creation to describe a process, where humans and AI work together to create new artifacts or solve a problem. We integrated structured co-creation activities into various phases of the project including ideation, conceptual design, and prototyping. We describe practical ways and learning goals for integrating emerging generative AI tools and ML models into the project design process, provide insight on how novice interaction designers iterate and collaborate with generative AI and ML models, and reflect on the merits and limitations of using generative AI tools and ML models for project-based interaction design courses for pervasive computing.},

  abstract={The generative artificial intelligence represented by ChatGPT brings great opportunities and challenges, resulting in rapid developments of AI collaborative academic writing. Problems exist as the output often turns out to be unreliable and the database lacks standardized and normalized content for academic writing. Considering the needs of writers, especially novices in academic writing, this study attempts to explore the high-quality interaction between humans and AI. Through discussing the pathway of applying move analysis and sentence stems in AI collaborative writing, this paper constructs an AI collaborative academic writing model to provide a clear framework and available expressions for academic AI collaborative writing.},

  abstract={This pilot study focuses on allowing students to use generative Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for their learning and assignments. Therefore, the study looks to improve the assignments to assess their learning. Students in their course have both formative and summative assessments. Both these assessments consist of writing, quizzes, and presentations. These students are both from the undergraduate and graduate levels. The study seeks to make the assessments sustainable for all teaching levels. The change in writing assessment would help to assess students better. The assignments are tested on ChatGPT and Bard to check if a student gets a passing grade using an AI tool.},

  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the cultivation of computer professionals faces new opportunities and challenges. Traditional training models can no longer meet the industry's demand for talent, making innovation in training models urgent. This paper proposes an innovative training model driven by generative artificial intelligence (GAI), which encompasses facilitating student-centered teaching models, strengthening engineering practice ability, and enhancing innovation awareness. A case study on the rebar counting problem is analyzed to illustrate the application of this new approach. The research findings are summarized to provide beneficial references for computer major talent training in universities.},

  abstract={The boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is opening up new opportunities in engineering. A variety of novel tools are flooding the market every day. However, integration into the industry processes is happening at a slow pace. This paper represents a survey conducted with 163 industrial engineers on the use of AI in product development. The questionnaire specifically focuses on the early phase of product development and investigates the current state, challenges and potentials. The results show a high level of interest in the use of AI, but integration into everyday working processes has been low so far. Among the few who incorporate AI into their concept development processes, an indication to shorter concept development times was observed. The automation of routine tasks and a conflicting requirements detection are seen as particularly promising AI applications. Main challenges and barriers lie in the expertise of employees, the costs of implementation and the usability of data. Nevertheless, more than two thirds state that further AI integration is planned. The focus here is particularly on generative AI.},

  abstract={A new wave of artificial intelligence applications that offer extensive benefits to our daily lives has been led to by dramatic success in machine learning. The loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability to vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and the general public--all with a range of legal implications. The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies, is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies; and performance evaluation of XAI.},
