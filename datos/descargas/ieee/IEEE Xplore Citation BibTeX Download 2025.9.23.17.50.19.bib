  abstract={This paper proposes a personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence, which aims to improve students' learning efficiency and interest through adaptive learning paths and content recommendations. The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles. VAE is used to construct a latent space representation of students' learning status and further optimize the personalized recommendation of learning content. To verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper conducted many simulation experiments. By analyzing the learning behavior data of different student groups, the system's performance in personalized recommendation and learning progress adaptation was evaluated. The experimental results show that the personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence has significant advantages in improving students' learning effects, shortening learning time, and increasing learning participation. Specific data show that the recommendation accuracy of the system reaches 92%, the learning efficiency is improved by 15%, and the student satisfaction is 20% higher than the traditional learning model.},

  abstract={In the presence of renewable resources, such as solar and wind, which are inherently intermittent, battery energy storage systems (BESS) are among the most popular energy storage solutions for increasing grid reliability and stability. Despite all the advantages, energy storage operations can be challenging, from monitoring the output of renewable energy sources to scheduling charging and discharging. The primary aim of this study is to predict renewable energy generation and energy consumption with the highest possible accuracy using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the optimal management of BESS. Specifically, the long-term short-term memory model (LSTM) is used. Then, OpenAI ChatGPT will be applied to support the prediction results and determine the optimal charging and discharging strategies.

  abstract={As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.},

  abstract={An antenna inverse design scheme based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed. The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},
