  volume={},

  pages={3629-3632},
  abstract={Reliable information on water quality is not currently available at the space and time scales that are required for aquaculture and other resource management needs. For example, shellfish growing areas may be impacted by harmful algal blooms or runoff from land that increases turbidity, lowers salinity, or introduces contaminants. Shellfish resource managers in the Chesapeake Bay are especially concerned with sources of bacteria from land such as failing onsite waste systems, failing wastewater infrastructure, and concentrated animal feeding operations. There is an urgent need for remote sensing of water quality indicators beyond chlorophyll-a and suspended sediments to augment field sampling programs. Artificial Intelligence trained with simultaneous in situ and satellite observations is explored in preparation for future hyperspectral satellite missions, which offer potential to detect additional water quality indicators not previously possible. This first step identifies and develops a method to harmonize disparate, unlinked aquatic datasets to derive information about where water quality is likely degraded.},

  abstract={In the era of rapid technological advancement, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming the way we work and interact with the world around us. The hiring process is a crucial aspect of any organization, as it determines the quality of the workforce and the success of the business. However, traditional hiring methods can be time-consuming and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose a better approach to hiring that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate and improve the efficiency of the process. Our proposed system allows managers to specify their requirements and receive a shortlist of candidates based on their skills, experience, and performance in a one-on-one interview with a photorealistic artificial intelligence bot. The bot also assesses candidates’ confidence and body language to rank them accordingly. By using AI and machine learning in the hiring process, we can save time and reduce bias, leading to better-quality hires and a more productive workforce.},

  abstract={Deep generative models have risen to prominence in diverse domains, including healthcare. In particular, their application in causal effect estimation has the potential to drive significant advancements in personalized medicine. In this study, we conducted an empirical analysis to investigate the impact of selection bias on continuous treatment effect estimation using deep generative models. Our results demonstrate that the presence of selection bias can lead to estimation performance disparities of up to 8 to 9 times. Such significant deviations pose severe risks in medical applications, where accurate treatment effect estimation is crucial for patient outcomes. Therefore, this paper underscores the criticality of addressing these challenges and proposes directions for future research to ensure the robust application of AI in healthcare.},

  abstract={This study examines the structure of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and factors influencing students’ attitudes, readiness, and perceived relevance of AI in higher education at Central European universities. The research, based on data from 1,195 students enrolled in various study programs between 2022 and 2024, examines how variables such as gender, academic discipline, and year of study influence perceptions related to AI. A validated questionnaire targeting constructs including satisfaction, readiness, and relevance of AI was used. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify significant differences between groups, including Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests with Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc analysis. The findings reveal consistent differences across genders and disciplines, with males and IT students demonstrating significantly higher readiness and satisfaction with AI. Furthermore, satisfaction levels fluctuated over time, peaking in 2023 – likely influenced by the widespread adoption of tools like ChatGPT. Correlation analysis further highlighted the subtle interrelationships between constructs across different subgroups. The study underscores the importance of tailored AI education strategies and calls for targeted interventions to ensure equitable engagement with AI across diverse student populations.},

  abstract={The swift progress of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools offers remarkable potential for revolutionizing educational methods and enhancing social sustainability. Despite its potential, understanding the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by integrating AI attributes (“perceived anthropomorphism,” “perceived intelligence,” and “perceived animacy”) with the theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic, and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048 university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms. Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy were also found to influence students’ attitudes significantly. More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects, and sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for various stakeholders.},

  abstract={Personalized learning refers to a system of teaching and learning where the content, methods, and assessment are tailored to each learner's needs, capacities/skills/competencies, and pace. There is abundant literature about personalized learning, describing its advantages, challenges, and approaches to implementing it. This study has explored the abundant literature and realized that while there are substantial proposed ways to achieve personalized learning, these proposals are not implemented into actionable products. This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the “Custom GPT” component has been implemented and tested on a course named “Applied Cryptography” in a postgraduate program. Though the preliminary results are promising, an effective assessment of the system will be made when the full implementation is completed. Further, issues related to ethics, scaling and integration with learning management systems should also be considered. Subsequent work to this study will focus on those issues.},

  abstract={The fashion business is growing quickly and is one of the main forces behind the world's economies. The everexpanding business is driving a significant rise in the application of computer science to address various issues inside it. It becomes difficult to discover a personalized wardrobe that reflects their preferences, taste and needs. Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed. Detailed analysis of the input parameters, to be considered to design the efficient AI based FRS (AI-FRS) is also presented. Along with this, research gaps are explored by surveying numerous review papers. This review will help in deciding the evaluation parameters to develop and examine more efficient AI based FRS.},

  abstract={Software developer's approaches to coding, testing, and deployment are changing due to the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software development. AI-Augmented Software Development Tools simplify repetitive activities, boost productivity, and lessen the cognitive load on developers by utilizing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and other AI techniques. These tools support several development phases, including DevOps optimization, testing automation, problem discovery, and code generation. For example, AI-driven systems find flaws and inefficiencies in the code, while AI-powered code generation tools like GitHub Copilot help with code suggestion and completion. Additionally, AI automates debugging and test case creation, ensuring the scalability and dependability of software systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) improves quality assurance in complex contexts such as microservices and APIs by maximizing test coverage and identifying abnormalities. Additionally, AI-powered assistants help guide engineers through code inspections, security checks, and performance optimization. Notwithstanding these advantages, there are drawbacks to using AI tools, such as privacy issues and an excessive reliance on automation. With continued development, these tools have the potential to not only expedite development but also redirect the developer's attention towards more complex problem resolution, thereby transforming software engineering methodologies.

  abstract={Despite the myriad peer-reviewed papers demonstrating novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges during the pandemic, few have made a significant clinical impact, especially in diagnosis and disease precision staging. One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.},

  abstract={Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models face significant challenges in abstract reasoning tasks, which require deep understanding and generalization across a wide range of domains. This study introduces a novel hybrid multicomponent architecture designed to enhance AGI performance on abstract reasoning tasks. The proposed model integrates advanced techniques including Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each component addresses distinct aspects of the task: Transformers capture sequence dependencies, GNNs model complex relationships between entities, GANs generate realistic data for training, and RL optimizes reasoning strategies. The synergy of these components allows the model to achieve strong generalization and abstract learning capabilities, significantly improving performance compared to single-component models. The experimental results on the ARC-AGI benchmark demonstrate the superiority of this hybrid approach, with marked improvements in key performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), and AUC-ROC. These results confirm that the proposed model is a promising solution to overcoming the limitations of current AGI systems in tackling novel and complex reasoning tasks. Future work will focus on further optimization of the model components, expanding its scope to more complex tasks, and evaluating its performance in practical applications such as natural language understanding and robotics.},

  abstract={The rapid rate at which technology has progressed in the last few decades has resulted in emerging technological solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI). AI is increasingly being used in business management decision-making processes to make more informed, better-informed, and more intelligent decisions. It is important to consider the intelligent implications of AI-driven decision-making in business management in order to ensure that the decisions made are not only effective but are also ethical, responsible, and beneficial to all stakeholders involved. AI has enabled decision makers to access and analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This can aid decision-makers in making better-informed decisions as well as reducing costs and saving time. AI can also assist decision-makers in identifying important patterns or trends within datasets and in finding solutions to problems that might have otherwise been overlooked. Additionally, AI can also help to identify potential opportunities to improve the efficiency of existing processes and systems.},

  abstract={This paper presents the approach and results of Experienc-IA, a project developed as part of a course on strategic planning, innovation, and foresight in the Journalism degree program at the University of Málaga in the 2022–23 academic year. With the pretext of implementing the SWOT-CAME applied research approach seen in the course, the project focuses on a common theme that is essential to reflect on and educate professionals and future professionals today: Artificial Intelligence (AI). First, each student conducts a user test and a SWOT analysis on a specific AI tool. Later, we do several face-to-face sessions to share results and conduct an overall SWOT-CAME analysis. The outcome is a collaborative document that profiles and categorizes over 40 generative AI or information verification tools. The results show positive outcomes in terms of participation, academic performance, assessment of the tool usage experience, and students' perception of their learning.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of mimicking human intelligence. Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence models that are designed to generate new data samples that are similar in nature to a given set of input data. The genesis of generative AI dates back to the mid&#x2010;20th century, rooted in foundational statistical modeling and pattern recognition techniques. Discriminative models, in the realm of machine learning, are primarily concerned with distinguishing between different classes or categories based on input data. Generative AI has revolutionized numerous fields with its ability to generate new, previously unseen content. Language models have undergone significant advancements over the past few years. At their core, these models are designed to understand and generate human language. In summary, AI acts as a catalyst in the economic sphere, promoting growth, enhancing efficiency, and redefining business operations.</p>},
