  title={A color style fusion design method based on generative adversarial networks}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={338-343},
  abstract={Fusion design is an innovative design approach in product color design. The fusion design makes the color matching richer. It not only can be simultaneously with a variety of styles but also fully express the design concept. However, the manual completion of the fusion design process takes time and effort. With the development of artificial intelligence, some designers apply intelligent algorithms to fusion design and significantly improve design efficiency. However, most design methods only achieve style migration from the source domain product style to the target domain product in one direction, leading to the resulting design solution losing some of the style information of the target domain product. We propose a color-style fusion design method based on generative adversarial networks. Take the eyeshadow color design as an example. Firstly, the source domain art painting dataset and the target domain eyeshadow dataset are collected, and the CycleGAN extracts the color styles of both to fuse to generate an eyeshadow color scheme with artistic style. The experimental results show that the proposed method can meet the color design concept of color cosmetics and retain the original art painting color style, providing a reference for designers and a new idea for product fusion design.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-17},
  abstract={Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation–a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation–remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2 Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2 Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2 Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.

  abstract={This study investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated personalized images to address the underrepresentation of female students in university engineering programs and promote gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Persistent gender disparities in STEM present significant barriers to diversity and innovation, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to inspire underrepresented groups. The research involved 76 high school students from scientific tracks, who were shown with AI-generated personalized images portraying themselves working in STEM-related professions. Results indicate that self-envisioning in STEM fields increased for both genders after the intervention, with the effect being four times greater for female students. In engineering fields specifically, a significant increase in selfenvisioning was observed among female students, while no significant impact was found for male students-likely due to the historical underrepresentation of women and the influence of gender stereotypes on career aspirations. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-generated personalized images as a novel tool to reduce gender disparities in STEM. Integrating such an approach into career counseling could enhance participation and foster diversity in STEM disciplines.},

  abstract={The rapid convergence of generative AI (GAI), neuro-symbolic reasoning, and quantum computing has redefined secure communication and networking. Owing to the massive amounts of data, the need for extensive computing power, and the necessity to find and mitigate threats in real-time, traditional security measures cannot keep up with changing cyber threats as the communication infrastructure becomes more complicated. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential of a GAI-enhanced neuro-symbolic quantum framework for building security systems that are strong, scalable, and self-sufficient. This method improves threat detection, encryption, and real-time adversarial defense by combining symbolic reasoning for logic, deep learning for pattern recognition, and quantum intelligence to accelerate computations.

  abstract={Iodinated contrast agents are widely utilized in numerous interventional procedures, yet posing substantial health risks to patients. This paper presents CAS-GAN, a novel GAN framework that serves as a “virtual contrast agent” to synthesize X-ray angiographies via disentanglement representation learning and vessel semantic guidance, thereby reducing the reliance on iodinated contrast agents during interventional procedures. Specifically, our approach disentangles X-ray angiographies into background and vessel components, leveraging medical prior knowledge. A specialized predictor then learns to map the interrelationships between these components. Additionally, a vessel semantic-guided generator and a corresponding loss function are introduced to enhance the visual fidelity of generated images. Experimental results on the XCAD dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our CAS-GAN, achieving a FID of 5.87 and a MMD of 0.016. These promising results highlight CAS-GAN’s potential for clinical applications.},

  abstract={The motivation of this paper is to be able to generate high-quality (Structured Query Language) SQL language sentences in terms of syntax and semantics so that they are intended to achieve a concrete predefined and well-known aim. For example, generating SQL sentences that are capable of detecting a cyber-attack from a set of metrics available in a database table. Two solutions are needed to achieve so, a tool that enables and performs the syntactically valid generation of SQL sentences and an (Artificial intelligence) AI algorithm able to guide the semantics of such generations to the achievement of the best sentences for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this manuscript is the first of these solutions. To be concrete, this paper proposes a tool to enable and generate syntactic-valid language sentences. The tool can deal with any language defined as an ANTLR4 EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar. The paper also provides a methodology to help achieve an EBNF grammar suitable for addressing concerns related to ambiguity and recursion as a direct result of the generation process. The paper further implements a prototype utilizing ANTLR4’s recognizer and its Augmented Transition Network for language generation using EBNF grammars. In-depth design and logic implementation are provided, showcasing areas of interest for AI integration. The achieved prototype showed an ability to easily generate syntactically valid SQL statements at various depths, with observable problems becoming more apparent during the exponential recursive growth. Our mitigation controls for such scenarios proved to be successful and were able to complete the recursion whilst also moving the push-down automata forward until query completion. Experimental validation was performed against a SQL EBNF grammar feeding the generated SQL statement into an SQL parser to validate the syntax.},

  abstract={In Recent years, Representation learning as one of the information extraction and data mapping methods in machine learning systems has received huge attention. Artificial deep neural networks are considered as one of the basic structures capable of representation learning. However, a large number of standard representation learning methods are supervised and requires a lot of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised representation learning by designing and implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) in combination with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main idea behind the proposed method, which causes the superiority of this method over others is representation learning via the generative models and encoder networks altogether. In this research, encoders are utilized in addition to the generative models to help the more features to be extracted. It is shown that the proposed method not only help feature extraction but accelerate and improve the performance of the learning in GANs which lead to better feature extraction. The results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach regarding classification accuracy by 2% to 6% improvement over other unsupervised feature learning methods.},

  abstract={In the context of smart farming, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in enhancing agricultural practices, from soil management to crop yield optimization. By leveraging deep learning and image processing techniques, AI can address various challenges across different agricultural sectors, particularly in detecting and mitigating plant diseases. This paper focuses on the use of these technologies for leaf disease detection to minimize crop loss. Deep learning and image processing are key components in identifying, classifying, and monitoring plant diseases. The study reviews various types of leaf diseases and examines the effectiveness of existing algorithms for detection. To improve performance, an algorithm based on ensemble learning methods is proposed. Experimental investigation is conducted on tomato leaf diseases, followed by a comparative analysis of the results. The proposed AI-driven system enables early disease detection, facilitating timely monitoring and intervention, ultimately reducing crop loss and improving overall crop health through proactive management and precautionary measures.},

  abstract={The purpose of this research paper is to investigate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into Australian higher education. This study will emphasise the advantages, disadvantages, and ethical repercussions of adopting an "AI-first mindset." This mindset delves into students and faculty, encouraging the use of AI tools for academic research, assessments, and support in educational settings. With the rising use of AI technology by educational institutions to improve learning outcomes, providing personalised student experience and streamline administrative procedures. It is becoming increasingly important to evaluate both the potential benefits and the inherent problems associated with the advent of AI. This research adopts a mixed-methods approach, with quantitative surveys of educators and students used along with qualitative interviews from other stakeholders in the tech industry. The research findings indicate that even though AI tools can improve engagement and efficiency, issues around data privacy, the digital gap, and the possibility of AI bias exist in algorithms. A critical analysis is also performed on the ethical considerations surrounding academic integrity and educators' role in an environment enhanced by artificial intelligence. At the end of the article, recommendations are made for legislative frameworks and best practices that will lead to the appropriate integration of artificial intelligence in higher education. These recommendations will ensure that the advantages are maximised while mitigating the dangers connected with the integration. This research contributes to the changing environment of higher education in the digital era and gives insights to institutions striving to create an ethical and inclusive approach to AI deployment.},

  abstract={The past few years have experienced significant strides in the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in high-quality image generation. This paper provides a detailed review about the most prominent GAN models that have shaped the development of more realistic synthetic images. The aim of this paper is to help researchers review the most significant advancements and gain insights regarding their basics, working, limitations and future scope. The major driving force for the rapid development of GANs is the extensive work done to solve training instability, mode collapse, and visual artifact issues. These issues make training a GAN a difficult process. To address this concern, we chose six pioneering models for in-depth analysis—StyleGAN, StyleGAN-XL, StarGAN, Slicing Adversarial Network (SAN), Diffusion GAN, GigaGAN. These models shattered previous record FID scores and results in unprecedented image generation performance, fundamentally shifting the benchmark of excellence in the field. They have shown to leverage new architectures that advance the state of generative AI. We emphasize their performance regarding the accuracy, variance, and realism of images, as well as the potential impact of these technologies on diverse fields from medical imaging to deepfake detection, object recognition, image editing, and material science. We extend our review by providing a model idea that could help generate finer emotion conditioned images inspired by StarGAN-XL and StyleGAN architecture.},

  abstract={We are in a golden age of progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Radiotherapy is perfectly suited to benefit from AI to enhance accuracy and efficiency due to its technology-intensive nature and direct human–machine interactions. While large amount of AI research have recently been published in the field of photon therapy, applications of AI specifically targeted for particle therapy remain scarcely investigated. There are two distinct differences between the photon therapy and particle therapy: 1) beam interaction physics (photons versus charged particles) and 2) beam delivery mode (e.g., IMRT/VMAT versus pencil beam scanning). Consequently, different strategies of AI deployment are required for these two radiotherapy modalities. In this article, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of recent literature exclusively focusing on AI-powered particle therapy. Six major aspects are included: 1) treatment planning; 2) dose calculation; 3) range and dose verification; 4) image guidance; 5) quality assurance; and 6) adaptive replanning. A number of perspectives, as well as potential challenges and common pitfalls, are also discussed.},
