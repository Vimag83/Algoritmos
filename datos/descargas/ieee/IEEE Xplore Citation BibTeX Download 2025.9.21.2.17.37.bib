  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, especially the rise of large-scale language models and diffusion models, the field of semantic communication is facing new opportunities and challenges. Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness. This paper provides an innovative path for the design and implementation of semantic communication system.},

  abstract={Generative models are an important class of models in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike models that aim to establish a mapping between inputs and outputs by extracting features, the goal of generative models is to learn the distribution of training data and generate new samples with similar features from a latent space. In the development of generative models, efforts have been made to improve the diversity of generated samples, progressing from VAE (variational auto-encoders). VAE achieves random sampling and generation of diverse images by transforming the bottleneck layer of the encoder from predicting low-dimensional feature maps to predicting positions sampled from a normal distribution. Subsequently, vector quantized variational autoencoders(VQ-VAE) and VQ-VAE-2 models were introduced, followed by the first-generation DALL-E model, and then diffusion models. We will discuss the basic principles of each model, the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and the innovations introduced by each model compared to its predecessors. After that, an overview of the evaluation metrics specific to generation models is provided. Finally, the applications that generation model enables are summarized. This review provides creative ideas for the future development of generative models.},

  abstract={The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative AI, is poised to bring significant changes to various aspects of the human world. While there is ongoing debate about the use of AI for writing manuscripts, completing assignments, and other working tasks, this research takes a step back to address a fundamental question: How accurate and efficient is AI in helping to conduct research? This research focuses on the initial step of research - literature search and screening. As the volume of academic literature grows exponentially, efficient and effective methods for synthesizing existing knowledge become crucial for scientific discovery. This research aims to explore the potential of AI-driven solutions in the literature screening process and compare them with traditional labor- and time-intensive approaches. Adopting a comparative analysis approach, this research examines both traditional manual screening techniques and AI-powered approaches and evaluates AI’ s performances. Data were collected from a comprehensive review of existing literature on the multidisciplinary topic of the digital divide. The analysis focuses on the accuracy, efficiency, and usefulness of AI in processing large volumes of literature. Results suggested that AI-driven approaches can reduce substantial manual work and time investment while maintaining certain levels of accuracy in identifying relevant studies. However, the challenge of algorithmic bias remains, and this calls for human intervention. Instead of AI replacing humans, our findings suggest a hybrid approach - combining AI capabilities with human expertise. Such an approach offers the most promising solutions for future literature review and screening processes, evidencing the synergy between AI and humans.},

  abstract={The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), into higher education presents both opportunities for pedagogical innovation and challenges to academic integrity. While recent initiatives, such as the European Union's AI Act and UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, have provided frameworks for ethical AI adoption, their practical implementation at the institutional level remains uneven. This study investigates how university faculty perceive the ethical implications of AI use in academic environments. Conducted as part of the EmpowerAI Erasmus+ project, a structured focus group involving 21 lecturers from the Technical University of Sofia in Bulgaria explored faculty staff attitudes toward AI's role in areas such as critical thinking, authorship, fairness, access, and privacy. Through thematic analysis, the study identifies emerging tensions between innovation and responsibility, and between equitable access and academic rigor. The findings underscore the need for context-sensitive institutional policies and educator training on AI ethics. The paper aims to contribute empirical evidence to the growing body of literature on responsible AI integration in higher education and informs the co-creation of actionable ethical guidelines that reflect both regulatory expectations and academic values.},

  abstract={Night vision technology provides an important means for night observation by using infrared radiation of the target as the imaging basis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) has become a research hotspot. Realizing the classification and recognition of infrared images by ANN is helpful to the intelligent development of night vision technology, as well as improve the accurate judgment of the surrounding environment by unmanned vehicles at night, and better ensure the safety of people and vehicles. However, the existing infrared image data set contains a small number of images, and the types of scenes and targets presented in the images are single, which cannot support the training of ANN. ANN cannot obtain the classification function of infrared images through full learning. In this paper, an infrared image generative model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can convert the existing visible light data set into the infrared version of the data set in a short time, and then solve the problem of lack of infrared image data sets. To train ResNet by infrared version data set can realize its classification function for infrared images. The model with the existing image generative model is compared through several evaluation indexes. The results show that the model is more effective in generative infrared images. Inputting ImageNet data set into this model can generate ImageNet infrared version data set. ResNet trained by this data set has a classification and recognition accuracy of 91.28%, which is higher than the experimental results of existing image generative models. The design and implementation of infrared image generative model in this paper promote the application of artificial intelligence and depth learning in night vision technology and other fields.},

  abstract={This article unveils CodeBlizz, an innovative AI-powered add-on for IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio Code. This software program makes use of generative AI to provide developers with seamless access to educational assets along with support for real-time debugging, and context-aware code suggestions. Compared to various code completion tools on the market, CodeBlizz takes a complete strategy to dramatically lower the learning curve for inexperienced workers while simultaneously increasing coding productivity. This is achieved through the direct integration of learning resources into the working environment. CodeBlizz utilizes proficient transformer-based models, such as CodeBERT for comprehending syntax and producing useful snippets and GPT-3 to generate context-aware code referrals. Also, the plugin employs T5 models to provide real-time problem detection and debugging support by turning malfunctioning code into error messages and possible fixes. Added to that, adaptive learning from user feedback is feasible with reinforcement learning models such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which boosts the accuracy of the model over time. Together, these machine learning elements allow CodeBlizz to provide developers with solid and dynamic support from within the IDE, which helps to boost accuracy and speed up code completion. Without pushing users to leave the IDE, the plugin renders functionalities encompassing dynamically generated code snippets, syntax correction, error pattern identification, and real-time tutorials for learning at ease. On the survey, users reported a thirty percent reduction in time spent on error correction and tutorial seeks from online websites, which further validates the benefit of incorporating AI that generates code for immediate guidance within the coding routine. Early testing demonstrates a significant boost in coding accuracy.},

  abstract={Digital literacy plays an important role in teachers’ professional competence, especially in the context of digital transformation in education. With the advancement of digital technology, enhancing learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy has become a key step in literacy development. On this basis, this study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate various test indicators, including the number of words, number of answer points, and number of follow-up rounds, and evaluation indicators, including accuracy, expansion, and awareness, for generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A four-step process was followed that includes basic analysis of experiment results, factor estimation and variance analysis, multifactor response surface analysis, and indicator analysis. The findings indicate that the test factors related to the GAI-generated content had a significant impact on participants’ high awareness levels. These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy. On the basis of the research conclusions, practical approaches to applying GAI to enhance high awareness ability in digital literacy are proposed. These approaches include employing the critical point perturbation mechanism, role-oriented mechanism, and high awareness thinking chain mechanism. This study employed GAI to investigate learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy, providing a case for the proper and innovative use of GAI in the context of education. Additionally, it provides information on the educational effectiveness of GAI and offers valuable references for similar studies on GAI applications.},

  abstract={Graphics algorithms for high quality image rendering are highly involved process, as layout, components, and light transport must be explicitly simulated. While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.},

  abstract={Designing programs is a purposeful method of implementing design plans in a scientific manner, playing a key role in normative design processes, improving efficiency, ensuring quality, and guiding creativity in artistic design. However, traditional design processes are often constrained by factors such as human resources, time costs, and experience limitations, resulting in inefficiency and limited creativity. Generative artificial intelligence is providing new possibilities for optimizing design processes. This article proposes an optimized design program strategy that can improve the efficiency of design programs, reduce design costs, and enhance design quality by introducing generative artificial intelligence. In addition, the optimized design program is evaluated from aspects such as the efficiency of process execution, the quality of design results, and the participation and satisfaction of team members to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Findings of this study can help researchers and practitioners develop and optimize models that are more suitable for content output, promoting their application in the field of artistic design.},

  abstract={Since its first appearance, artificial intelligence has been ensuring revolutionary outcomes in the context of real-world problems. At this point, it has strong relations with biomedical and today&#x2019;s intelligent systems compete with human capabilities in medical tasks. However, advanced use of artificial intelligence causes intelligent systems to be black-box. That situation is not good for building trustworthy intelligent systems in medical applications. For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This book provides an essential edited work regarding the latest advancements in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for biomedical applications. It includes not only introductive perspectives but also applied touches and discussions regarding critical problems as well as future insights. Topics discussed in the book include: &#x2022; XAI for the applications with medical images &#x2022; XAI use cases for alternative medical data/task &#x2022; Different XAI methods for biomedical applications &#x2022; Reviews for the XAI research for critical biomedical problems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Applications is ideal for academicians, researchers, students, engineers, and experts from the fields of computer science, biomedical, medical, and health sciences. It also welcomes all readers of different fields to be informed about use cases of XAI in black-box artificial intelligence. In this sense, the book can be used for both teaching and reference source purposes.},

  abstract={Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging include classification, segmentation, and treatment planning. Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model. Overall, artificial CT images generated by PGGAN were almost indistinguishable from real images to the human eye, although computational metrics could identify differences between them. In future work, GANs may be deployed to augment data for training medical AI systems.},
