  abstract={This research paper explores the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) techniques to create synthetic medical datasets that balance data realism and privacy preservation. The sensitivity of medical records poses challenges for data access and sharing, making GAI a promising solution. The study evaluates five key approaches—StyleGAN2, CLIP, T5, ViT, and specialized Tabular GANs—across three critical dimensions: distribution fidelity, attribute correlation preservation, and pattern recognition accuracy. The results reveal the strengths and limitations of each technique in generating realistic medical data. StyleGAN2, CLIP, and T5 excel in all dimensions, making them ideal for various applications requiring high-quality synthetic medical datasets. ViT shows promise but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases, while specialized Tabular GANs demonstrate potential but vary in performance. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare data generation. It underscores the potential of Generative AI in addressing the tabular data generation challenge in medical records, offering realistic and privacy-conscious alternatives for data utilization and model training.},

  pages={8873-8883},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an imperative role in next-generation critical infrastructures like the smart grid, whose power can be harnessed by not only operators, but also cyber adversaries. This article investigates a potential threat from adversarial AI in blind false data injection attacks (FDIA) targeting the ac state estimators in the smart grid. Assuming no access to the grid topology required in most FDIA, we propose an adversarial model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to infer grid topology from historical measurements. Following the topology inference, a substitute bad data detector (BDD) model is further proposed in the attack model to filter the false data before injection, reducing the risk of detection given potential bad data in normal operations. We also refine the common evaluation of FDI stealthiness by including the presence of bad data among normal and false data when assessing the detection performance. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus system reveal that significant deviations can be inflicted stealthily by the proposed blind FDI attack. Detailed analyses of the stealthiness, impacts, and parameters are also presented to shed more light on the threats for further studies and effective countermeasures.},

  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The imbalanced dataset is a challenging issue in many classification tasks. Because it leads a machine learning algorithm to poor generalization and performance. The imbalanced dataset is characterized as having a huge difference between the number of samples that contain each class. Unfortunately, various resampling methods are proposed to solve this problem. In our work, we target enhancing the handling of the imbalanced dataset using a new oversampling technique based on generative adversarial neural networks. Our method is benchmarked against the widely used oversampling technique including the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random oversampling technique (ROS), and the adaptive synthetic sampling approach(ADSYN). Additionally, three machine learning algorithms are used for evaluation. The outcome of our experiments on a real-world credit card dataset shows the strong ability of the proposed solution against the competitive oversampling techniques to overcome the imbalanced problem in the European credit card dataset.},

  abstract={This paper delves into the significance and interaction between deep learning (DL) and neural architecture search (NAS) within the realm of artificial intelligence. As DL has become integral in addressing complex problems through its robust learning capabilities, NAS offers the potential to autonomously discover efficient neural network structures. The fusion of these technologies not only enhances model performance but also accelerates the proliferation of AI applications, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as embedded devices and edge computing. This study provides an in-depth comparative analysis of multiple neural network models applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a particular focus on the performance of the Darts-SEBnet model. By incorporating a self-attention mechanism, the Darts-SEBnet model demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy over the baseline VGG16 model. Furthermore, the paper reviews the evolution of NAS, emphasizing the success of gradient-based search methods like DARTS and its variants in improving search efficiency and model performance. The findings suggest that the integration of DL and NAS could drive further innovations in AI, offering solutions to existing bottlenecks and expanding AI's applicability across diverse fields.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into innovation management has expanded into creative domains such as Design Thinking (DT), yet its role within complex, collaborative innovation frameworks remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how professionals perceive and utilize AI in DT workshops. Using affordance theory as a conceptual lens, we conducted observational studies and semi-structured interviews with DT experts to identify AI's action potentials, constraints, and mitigation strategies in this context. Our findings highlight four key affordances of AI in DT workshops: enhanced creativity, support for analytical tasks, facilitation of task initiation, and acceleration of processes. However, these benefits are tempered by challenges, including reduced team collaboration, diminished ownership of AI-generated outputs, and disruptions to workshop flow. The study reveals distinct human-AI interaction archetypes, underscoring the dynamic interplay between human expertise and AI capabilities. To mitigate constraints, we propose strategies such as pre-preparing AI-generated content, defining clear roles for AI and human inputs, and fostering collaborative reflection on AI outputs. By illuminating AI's potential and limitations within DT, this research contributes to the innovation management literature and offers actionable insights for practitioners seeking to integrate AI into hybrid innovation processes.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the emerging field of emotional engineering which takes the form of a marriage between generative artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence that is set to redefine the future of human-machine collaboration. With the latest advances in AI having allowed for broad understanding and generation of human-like emotional responses, this paper illuminates the frameworks for creating systems that are capable of empathizing with and responding to the emotions of human users that can be widely applied across domains such as healthcare and customer service. The findings here indicate that user experiences can be drastically improved through applications such as those which allow for machines to accompany emotional intelligence, as they can enable more empathetic interactions. Emotion AI isn’t about having "feelings" in the human sense — it’s more about accurate and relevant emotional interaction. There’s no doubt "emotional engineering" will spawn gadgets that are truly empathetic and not just intelligent, but it also raises large questions about what happens now that we must account for emotions in our digital interactions.},

  year={2024},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={1504-1515},
  abstract={Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive disorder affecting millions of individuals, presenting a significant global health concern. Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) serves as a crucial tool in revealing functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD, playing an essential role in precise diagnosis. However, the limited data availability of FC poses challenges for robust MDD diagnosis. To tackle this, some studies have employed Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architectures to construct Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic FC generation, but this tends to overlook the inherent topology characteristics of FC. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based Conditional GAN with Class-Aware Discriminator (GC-GAN). GC-GAN utilizes GCN in both the generator and discriminator to capture intricate FC patterns among brain regions, and the class-aware discriminator ensures the diversity and quality of the generated synthetic FC. Additionally, we introduce a topology refinement technique to enhance MDD diagnosis performance by optimizing the topology using the augmented FC dataset. Our framework was evaluated on publicly available rs-fMRI datasets, and the results demonstrate that GC-GAN outperforms existing methods. This indicates the superior potential of GCN in capturing intricate topology characteristics and generating high-fidelity synthetic FC, thus contributing to a more robust MDD diagnosis.},

  abstract={The success of artificial intelligence (AI) in multiple disciplines and vertical domains in recent years has promoted the evolution of mobile networking and the future Internet toward an AI-integrated Internet of Things (IoT) era. Nevertheless, most AI techniques rely on data generated by physical devices (e.g., mobile devices and network nodes) or specific applications (e.g., fitness trackers and mobile gaming). Therefore, generative AI (GAI), a.k.a. AI-generated content (AIGC), has emerged as a powerful AI paradigm; thanks to its ability to efficiently learn complex data distributions and generate synthetic data to represent the original data in various forms. This impressive feature is projected to transform the management of mobile networking and diversify the current services and applications provided. On this basis, this work presents a concise tutorial on the role of GAIs in mobile and wireless networking. In particular, this survey first provides the fundamentals of GAI and representative GAI models, serving as an essential preliminary to the understanding of GAI’s applications in mobile and wireless networking. Then, this work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies and GAI applications in network management, wireless security, semantic communication, and lessons learned from the open literature. Finally, this work summarizes the current research on GAI for mobile and wireless networking by outlining important challenges that need to be resolved to facilitate the development and applicability of GAI in this edge-cutting area.},

As an experiment for the evaluation of imitated motion images, we performed experiments with our collaborators. Then, we asked the collaborators for their opinions about real and imitated motion images. The results suggest that the imitated motion images are more effective. Because manual processing to produce imitated motion images is too much work, the existing technology, Pose2Pose, is used.

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV) by providing foundational and personalized knowledge. However, their inherently contradictory characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay between GAI and EI.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools have been gaining significant attention since November 2022 with the proliferation of chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Bard. Being described as ‘revolutionary’ and promising significant potential for advancements in all sectors from learning, teaching, and researching to administrative and industrial fields, from the creation of content to the development of software, they have emerged as a transformative force. Much of the literature refers to GenAI as ‘new’ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and highlights their benefits which range from automating repetitive tasks, personalizing learning experiences, to fostering creativity. Despite their potential, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding practical guidance on the specific tools available and their applications in educational settings. This research aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive list of GenAI tools and platforms tailored for educational use. The paper draws on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations Theory, highlighting the importance of enhancing perceived usefulness and ease of use to facilitate the adoption of GenAI technologies in education. By cataloging and briefly presenting the various GenAI tools, this research provides faculty and students with the necessary information that may facilitate integration of these tools and promote a more innovative and efficient educational environment. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge by bridging the gap between the theoretical potential of GenAI and its practical applications in educational practices.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the practical issues in developing and probable future implementation of lesson contents for learning outcomes tasks defined in a new curriculum which is going to be implemented in vocational schools with a new, modular approach. The significance of the modular approach is that it offers flexibility and adaptability, allowing educators to tailor content with a goal to meet both diverse student needs and industry demands. As a completely new and untested, the module “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning” delves into the challenges faced during the lesson planning process, such as ensuring accessibility and inclusivity, and fostering an engaging learning environment. The paper deals with the complexities of designing lesson plans and tasks that must impart theoretical knowledge and emphasize important direct experience. By leveraging the powerful and advanced capabilities of generative AI, educators, using wise and proper prompts, can design, create, and suit both module content and lesson plans, ensuring up-to-date and relevant content aligned with learning outcomes, including learning resources, tools, and proper methods for evaluation. Through a brief survey of some relevant research and experiences, the paper provides insight into fostering teaching methods and content that are attractive and innovative. This could be an approach that aims students to acquire competencies for personal and professional development, continuing education, and lifelong learning in the future, high ICT advanced surroundings.},

  abstract={A bstract-OpenAI made Generative Artificial Intelligence something most people have access to and a technology, people know of. Nowadays, businesses seek to utilize its maximal potential for smoothly balanced human-computer interaction and operational efficiency solutions. AI use continues to reduce tedious base work from day-by-day activities. Here Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) refers to a set of technologies, capable of e.g. producing meaningful texts, image, data analysis and operational activity suggestions. Well-known applications include proactivity enhancements, marketing material generation, product development, digital (twin) customer service agents, supply chain routing and optimization, business decision-making, etc. The full rainbow of different pipelines, where GAI tools are used in multiple different steps, is well less studied and known. Especially those pipelines, which by nature, are producing more profound changes in organizational productivity, work quality, error reduction, and overall end customer experience enhancement fronts. In this context, our research focuses on examining and analyzing modern-day GAI applications, product and service generation, marketing and user/customer experience-related business pipelines, and current practices, across a range of domains, on extending current academic and practical use basis knowledge of different applications and uses of GAI in context of many different industrial application areas. We help build the current status quo overall picture of GAI utilization areas, from product design to marketing and user experience, by investigating methods and architectures employed and advancing the practical significance of each application.},

  abstract={Contributions: An adoption framework to include generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the university curriculum. It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders (university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption. Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. GenAI has impacted our perspective on traditional methods of academic integrity and the scholarship of teaching, learning, and research. Both the faculty and students are unsure about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder involved. Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff to ensure the students’ learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI. How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup? Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment. Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard framework is proposed 1) for effective redesign of the course curriculum; 2) for enabling staff and students; and 3) to define an evaluation matrix to measure the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.},
