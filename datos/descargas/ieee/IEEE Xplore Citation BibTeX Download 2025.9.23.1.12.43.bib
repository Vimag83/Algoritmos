  abstract={The emergence of generative artificial intelligence has had a profound impact on education. This study, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method, analyzes 281 studies on the application of generative artificial intelligence in education. The results of this study can assist researchers in better understanding: (1) What are the key characteristics of the literature on generative artificial intelligence in education? (2) What is the current state of research on generative artificial intelligence in education? (3) How can generative artificial intelligence empower education to promote high-quality educational development? By examining these questions, we found that generative artificial intelligence in education presents contradictions—diverse demands and limited practice. Therefore, future efforts should focus on constructing region-specific large language models, educational corpora, and prompt engineering, thus further promoting the high-quality development of education.},

In the 2000s, as more and more of our everyday activities moved online, the resulting explosion in big data provided a huge boost for the evolution of AI. An area of recent development is domain&#x2010;specific generative models, which are models tailored to specific industries and applications, such as drug discovery. The roots of GenAI stretch as far back as the 1950s, when scientists and researchers first introduced the concept of intelligent machines. Most notably, the Turing Test&#x2013;designed to prove whether a computer can demonstrate human&#x2010;like intelligence &#x2013; was introduced in 1950. The mid&#x2010;2010s onwards saw the development of neural networks that power GenAIs. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 marked a significant milestone and spawned an AI arms race.</p>},

  abstract={CNC controls are widely used in modern manufac-turing technology. They play a important role for the productivity of the machine they control. Already today, these controls are reaching their performance limits in certain scenarios. The controller acts like a performance bottleneck for increasingly dynamic machine tools. To further increase the performance of CNC controllers, this work proposes an novel method based on the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for the direct generation of tool paths within the CNC controllers. We present a concept that enables interpolation with GAN. Based on this, a novel system architecture for the integration of GAN into an AI-module within CNC controls is developed. The new method is evaluated on the basis of an example contour. GAN trained to generate linear toolpaths are used for evaluation. A smoothing GAN is used to blend the sharp path transitions between the generated path segments.},

  abstract={Recommender Systems (RSs), which generate personalized content, have become a technological tool with diverse applications for users. While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based recommendation systems.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools are advanced systems capable of generating content in formats such as text, images, or videos, which has been transforming fields such as education. However, excessive use of these tools may result in students not fully utilizing their own skills, thereby diminishing their critical thinking, analytical abilities, and information search skills. This research aims to study the perceptions of higher education students regarding GAI tools to assess their experiences with the usefulness of these instruments and their impact on learning. To achieve this, a non-experimental, comparative, descriptive research approach with a quantitative focus was employed, involving theoretical and conceptual processing. An instrument was designed to measure dimensions such as ethics, experience, usefulness, and quality. Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them. The study also identified certain risks related to students' perception of these tools as substitutes for their teachers rather than as supportive aids and noted that they are perceived as potentially diminishing students' learning capacity.},

Generative artificial intelligence is an artificial intelligence system capable of generating texts, images, and other media based on the input training data. Although still in their early stages, numerous examples of such systems in different domains have gained widespread attention from the public, media, policymakers, and researchers. This study aims to explore the generative AI academic research in the past decade using bibliometrics, text analysis, and social network analysis. Specifically, research themes and their relationships, the evolution of research themes over time, and prominent authors, articles, journals, institutions, and countries publishing in generative AI are identified. The data was further found to partially support the classical bibliometrics laws of Zipf, and Bradford’s. The two overarching research themes identified using knowledge synthesis from most cited articles and journals are technical advancements and developments in generative AI systems; and their applications to image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. ChatGPT, large language models, and the application of generative AI to healthcare and education are emerging research topics.

  abstract={With the convergence of modern computing technology and social sciences, both theoretical research and practical applications of social computing have been extended to new domains. In particular, social computing was significantly influenced by the recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the conventional technologies of AI have various drawbacks in dealing with complicated and dynamic problems. Such deficiency can be rectified by hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which integrates both human intelligence and AI into one unity, forming a new enhanced intelligence. H-AI in dealing with social problems shows some advantages over the conventional AI. This article firstly reviews the latest research progresses of AI in social computing. Secondly, it summarizes typical challenges AI faces in social computing, which motivate the necessity to introduce H-AI to tackle social-oriented problems. Finally, we discuss the concept of H-AI and propose a holistic architecture of H-AI in social computing, which consists of three layers: object layer, intelligent processing layer, and application layer. The proposed architecture shows that H-AI has significant advantages over AI in solving social problems.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly been used to enhance threat intelligence and cyber security measures for organizations. Generative AI is a form of AI that creates new data without relying on existing data or expert knowledge. This technology provides decision support systems with the ability to automatically and quickly identify threats posed by hackers or malicious actors by taking into account various sources and data points. In addition, generative AI can help identify vulnerabilities within an organization's infrastructure, further reducing the potential for a successful attack. This technology is especially well-suited for security operations centers (SOCs), which require rapid identification of threats and defense measures. By incorporating interesting and valuable data points that previously would have been missed, generative AI can provide organizations with an additional layer of defense against increasingly sophisticated attacks.},

  title={The Role of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Personalized Design of Visual Communication}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={917-921},
  abstract={Based on the problems of insufficient design innovation and low design efficiency in personalized visual communication design, this study uses the style transfer algorithm to apply a specific artistic style to the design and automatically generates visual elements with personalized characteristics. At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to create new patterns and color combinations and enhance the diversity of design, while ChatGPT is used to parse user needs and transform text descriptions into design concepts. In the process of implementing these methods, this paper collects and analyzes user data to build user portraits to understand their preferences and needs. This paper also uses a style transfer algorithm to combine user-favorite elements with design templates to generate preliminary design sketches. Then GAN intervenes to generate new design elements and uses these elements to enrich and refine the design content. During the design process, the artificial intelligence model is continuously optimized based on user feedback to ensure that the final output design not only meets the user's personalized needs but is also highly innovative and attractive. Ultimately, these individually adjusted designs are output in an appropriate format for application in actual products or services. Based on comparative experiments, this paper found that personalized design is superior to traditional design methods in multiple key indicators: the average innovation score of personalized design is as high as 9.06, higher than the 6.89 of traditional design; the time required for personalized design is mainly concentrated between 20 and 30 minutes, while the time required for traditional design ranges from 30 to nearly 50 minutes and fluctuates greatly; the adoption rate of personalized design reaches a minimum of 90.2% and a maximum of 99.9%, while the adoption rate of traditional design is lower, with a minimum of only 75.2% and a maximum of only 88.7%. Through comparative analysis, this paper confirms the advantages of personalized design over traditional design in multiple dimensions, and demonstrates the application potential and value of artificial intelligence technology in the field of design.},
