  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including large language and image models, have created new opportunities for pervasive computing education. How do we integrate emerging AI models and tools into our courses in a way that fosters critical engagement? How do we teach students to use AI models and tools responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically, while being aware of their capabilities and limitations? In this article, we share insights from integrating generative AI tools and machine learning (ML) models into a project-based undergraduate tangible and embodied interaction (TEI) course by employing co-creation processes. TEI is an evolving area within human–computer interaction, which focuses on integrating computation into our daily physical environments and objects, thus fostering an embodied, multisensory, and often collaborative interaction experience. We use the term co-creation to describe a process, where humans and AI work together to create new artifacts or solve a problem. We integrated structured co-creation activities into various phases of the project including ideation, conceptual design, and prototyping. We describe practical ways and learning goals for integrating emerging generative AI tools and ML models into the project design process, provide insight on how novice interaction designers iterate and collaborate with generative AI and ML models, and reflect on the merits and limitations of using generative AI tools and ML models for project-based interaction design courses for pervasive computing.},

  abstract={The boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is opening up new opportunities in engineering. A variety of novel tools are flooding the market every day. However, integration into the industry processes is happening at a slow pace. This paper represents a survey conducted with 163 industrial engineers on the use of AI in product development. The questionnaire specifically focuses on the early phase of product development and investigates the current state, challenges and potentials. The results show a high level of interest in the use of AI, but integration into everyday working processes has been low so far. Among the few who incorporate AI into their concept development processes, an indication to shorter concept development times was observed. The automation of routine tasks and a conflicting requirements detection are seen as particularly promising AI applications. Main challenges and barriers lie in the expertise of employees, the costs of implementation and the usability of data. Nevertheless, more than two thirds state that further AI integration is planned. The focus here is particularly on generative AI.},

  abstract={A new wave of artificial intelligence applications that offer extensive benefits to our daily lives has been led to by dramatic success in machine learning. The loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability to vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and the general public--all with a range of legal implications. The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies, is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies; and performance evaluation of XAI.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Though useful tools for cyber defense, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) potentially have drawbacks. Threat actors can employ them to do their bidding. The cybersecurity landscape is quickly changing, encompassing AI&#x2010;powered malware, adversarial ML techniques, AI&#x2010;enabled botnets, and intensified insider threats. Cyber threats were growing globally faster than cyber defensive capabilities even before AI arose and was used. Cyberattacks in the past required much manual investigation, labour&#x2010;intensive planning, and patience. Cybercriminals are also taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the ecosystem of the growing networks of connected devices. Cyberattacks will become more sophisticated as result of generative AI, increasing the possibility of ransomware&#x2010;as&#x2010;a&#x2010;service, phishing, malware development, deepfakes, and the exposing of personally identifying information. Another kind of adversarial attack in the context of AI and ML models is AI poisoning. Polymorphic malware leverages polymorphism to evade detection instead of optimizing its effectiveness.</p>},

  pages={1796-1801},
  abstract={This study focuses on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of cultural creation and communication, and proposes an innovative multimodal fusion generative adversarial network algorithm (MM-GAN). The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.},

  abstract={Generative AI (GAI) is one of the significant components that can efficiently improve and augment the AI cycle model’s robustness when it comes to different threats, weaknesses, and abnormalities detection. When applied in this field, GAI is very useful in emulating the various forms of security violations in actual adversarial settings. These scenarios are important when different aspects of an AI system are tested on how robust they are and thus permit the developers to amend any vulnerability that may be induced before the time it could be utilized in practice. Data and model manipulation, data theft, and adversarial attacks as well as model inference threats which we do a systematic analysis to disrupt the integrity, confidentiality as well as availability of AI models. Considering the current weaknesses and threats related to GAI we provide a systematic approach to how safety concerns that are currently relevant can be integrated with every stage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle management: from continuous monitoring to the application of cybersecurity trends and practices, etc. In our approach, the emphasis is placed on the multi-level security management strategy that incorporates the improvement of coding practices, validation and testing, and the implementation of advanced intrusion detection systems. Before proceeding to further analysis and discussion of the given topic, it is also critical to mention the aspect of regulation and ethical concern as the major drivers of GAI usage. Additionally, organizations can involve GAI in the lifecycle to address security needs, during the development, acquisition, deployment, updating, maintenance, and decommissioning of the AI system, making them reliable, safe, and secure all through their lifecycle. Toward these ends, the goal of this work is to present a set of canonical recommendations for the many scientists, engineers, managers, technologists, and policymakers who will play a key role in constructing a sound and secure AI future.},

  abstract={The research on computer vision mainly aims to enable computers to understand and interpret images. Computer vision is an emerging discipline, and applying generative artificial intelligence technology to image processing is an important entry point in current machine vision research. When generating images, this article utilized adversarial learning mechanisms to optimize the parameters of the generator and discriminator, creating a competitive relationship between the two and gradually improving the quality of the generated images. Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00. The PSNR and SSIM values of the generated image with image number 3 in the experiment were relatively high and close to the corresponding values of the original image. This article provided a reference for the research on the application of generative artificial intelligence in visual effects.},

Generative AI models like ChatGPT have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing learning experiences by providing personalized, interactive, and adaptive education. However, the adoption of these advancements varies across regions due to differences in infrastructure, regulations, and resource access. This study addresses the need for a tailored policy framework to facilitate the adoption of generative AI in higher education institutions. It investigates the policy elements that enable the use and accessibility of these technologies, aiming to develop a comprehensive framework to guide the integration of AI in teaching. The proposed framework, with its focus on addressing educational disparities, seeks to ensure the strategic, responsible, and effective use of AI technologies, thereby improving the overall quality of education. A mixed-method approach was employed, integrating a systematic review and qualitative interviews to explore and propose a policy framework for adopting emerging technologies, particularly generative AI. It utilized primary and secondary data, with a comprehensive literature review identifying policy issues and input from 10 university experts verifying the policy items. The research identified ten key policy components categorized into three dimensions: governance, operation, and pedagogy, and discussed their implications. The conclusion emphasizes that incorporating AI through well-crafted policies significantly impacts its strategic integration in education. This study underscores the necessity of localized policy to fully harness the potential of emerging technologies in various educational contexts.},

  abstract={Analyzing human-machine collaboration behavior is crucial for integrating generative artificial intelligence(GAI) into the work of pre-service teachers, thereby enhancing teaching efficiency and quality. This study focuses on 55 pre-service teachers, employing lag sequential analysis and content analysis to examine their recorded collaboration processes and reflective texts. The aim is to explore the behavior patterns and characteristics of human-machine collaboration based on GAI. The findings indicate that the sequence C2→C1/C5→C3/C4→ C2 represents an efficient human-machine collaboration behavior pattern, in which pre-service teachers ask GAI questions, refine its responses based on their understanding, and iteratively collaborate to optimize lesson plans. The advantages of GAI in this collaboration include efficiency, comprehensive knowledge, clear logic, and lack of temporal and spatial constraints. However, its disadvantages are poor comprehension, limited professionalism, lack of personalization and innovation, reduced sense of communication, and technological limitations. The results provide significant insights for optimizing educational practices through collaboration between pre-service teachers and GAI.},

  abstract={Integrating generative artificial intelligence tools can allow one to manage and develop novel business methods efficiently. With the introduction of self-learning generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools, the corporate world is trying to figure out the applications and their business implications. Major technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc., have shown enormous interest in investing in ventures developing generative AI tools/models. These tools/models can be experimented with, and their business use is being explored. The study aims to explore the potential uses of generative AI (GAI) in academics through its current capabilities and applications. The study also highlights the potential challenges and concerns arising from using generative AI in academics. The study has used descriptive and quantitative methods to answer the research questions. The study has used a questionnaire based on the Likert scale to measure the significance of indirect variables, viz. perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived trust (PT) on direct variable adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AGAI) in academics. The sample size consists of 100 students and 100 university professors. The study Mentions that perceived ease of use (PEOU) positively influences GAI (AGAI) adoption. Also, perceived trust (PT) has a predictive ability of AGIA when controlling for PEOU. The use of generative AI in a few years will become imperative in most human lives, which makes it mandatory to explore the possible ways of its adoption in the mainstream rather than avoiding or restricting its usage in academics.},

  abstract={The recent rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the resulting market growth, has introduced new challenges for social responsibility, an area where companies may need more guidance. In this regard, the literature covers a broad spectrum, from the impact of bias to the potential use of this technology to implement undemocratic surveillance. Another focus area discusses the AI industry's commitment to human rights and social responsibility, examining the diverse actors involved in this commitment and the context-dependent nature of their impact on human rights. This work performs a systematic review and a comparative analysis of the strategies and actions taken by four leading companies—OpenAI, Meta AI Research, Google AI, and Microsoft AI—with respect to five critical dimensions: bias, privacy, cybersecurity, hate speech, and misinformation. Our study analyzes 192 publicly available documents and reveals that depending on the diversity of products and their nature, some companies excel in the research and development of technologies and methodologies for privacy preservation and bias reduction, offering user-friendly tools for managing personal data, establishing expert groups to research the social impact of their technologies, and possessing significant expertise in tackling hate speech and misinformation. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need for greater linguistic, cultural, and geographic diversity in research lines, tools, and collaborative efforts. From this analysis, we draw a set of actionable best practices aimed at supporting the responsible development of AI models, and foundation models, in particular, that are aligned with human rights principles.},
