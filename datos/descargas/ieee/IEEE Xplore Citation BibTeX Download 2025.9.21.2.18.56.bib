  abstract={The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational landscapes., particularly in computer science education. This study investigates research trends in generative AI applications through text network and topic modeling analyses. A comprehensive literature review across IEEE Xplore., Scopus., and Web of Science identified 151 studies published between 2023 and 2024. Text network analysis revealed that “AI.,” “student.,” “education.,” “learning.,” and “performance” were the most frequently occurring terms., highlighting key research themes. Ego-network analysis demonstrated strong interconnectivity between educational AI tools and student learning outcomes. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)., four major research topics emerged: educational chatbots (35.1 %)., AI literacy (25.8%)., exam performance (21.8%)., and technology integration (17.2%). Findings indicate a dominant focus on chatbots for student engagement., while ethical concerns and multimodal AI applications remain underexplored. The study underscores the necessity of addressing AI literacy gaps and enhancing interdisciplinary AI integration in educational settings. Despite its potential., generative AI adoption is hindered by privacy risks., uneven technological access., and the lack of standardized policies. Future research should focus on ethical AI frameworks., multimodal AI tools., and long-term learning outcomes. This study provides a data-driven foundation for understanding the evolving role of generative AI in education and its implications for educators., policymakers., and researchers.},

  abstract={Generative AI transforms education by making learning experiences better and more personalized. GAI overcomes some of the problems in traditional teaching by providing tools like ChatGPT and GANs, which create smart learning systems, design instructional materials, and provide interactive, engaging experiences. GAI is the key to supporting educators to automate resources, provide personal content, and focus on creativity and critical thinking. Its size of growth and adaptability can fill in any kind of knowledge gap, specifically in distressful regions for applications related to skill development, translation of languages, medical learning, and virtual teaching. Interoperability with VR and the metaverse modernizes education further. The issues in this are data collection, biases in algorithms, and the human interaction is reduced. That would require explainable algorithms and robust data protection. Policymakers, educators, and technologists must be in a joint effort to see that GAI is used justly. Democratized education, lifelong learning, and inclusive future promises GAI as they blend technology with pedagogy to reap maximum benefits and risks.},

  abstract={The paper is dedicated to the philosophical analysis of the specifics of artificial intelligence and its relation to human intelligence, as well as of the very notion of generative artificial intelligence and its abilities and inabilities. Emphasis is placed on such feature of human thinking as openness, which is argued to clearly distinguish it from machine thinking, as well as on such aspects of human intelligence as nonlinearity, morality, emotionality and evaluation that could be described as extra-rational and thus unobtainable for the artificial intelligence. It is argued that artificial intelligence cannot think openly, “out of the box”, going beyond the boundaries of purely rational reasoning and formal logic peculiar to classical type of rationality. The authors also conclude that the development of AI-based technologies makes it necessary to shift the higher education in the direction of strengthening the emphasis on the ethical, emotional, and volitional sphere of human intelligence.},

  abstract={AI Art Generators have recently developed in such a way that they have become accessible to everyone who has access to the internet. This paper looks into how the modern AI art generators work and identifies the various issues with AI art on technical, moral and legal grounds. Furthermore it aims to understands how the increased accessibility to AI art generators affects humans.Modern AI art generators use artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms and deep neural network algorithms to study a large amount of pre-existing artworks in portfolio and produce new art based on the prompts provided by the user. They use software such as CNN, GAN, NST.The biggest argument against AI art is that it needs the human creativity and imagination. But it has been argued that the human creativity is included in the text prompts provided by the artist. AI art generators have also been accused of stealing art works without permission of the artists which has been leading to some copyright issues. Furthermore AI art generators have been stealing artists’ commissions and work. AI art generators are not perfect yet and have several errors such as errors in the art generated such as anatomy errors(example: hands with six fingers instead of five etc). Artists have protested against the use of AI art generators. One such protest is the "No to AI generated images" movement wherein they flooded the portfolio in an AI art generator called "ArtStation" with images tagged as "trending in ArtStation in order to render all the generated images useless.},

  abstract={Mental disorders show a rapid increase and cause considerable harm to individuals as well as the society in recent decade. Hence, mental disorders have become a serious public health challenge in nowadays society. Timely treatment of mental disorders plays a critical role for reducing the harm of mental illness to individuals and society. Music therapy is a type of non-pharmaceutical method in treating such mental disorders. However, conventional music therapy suffers from a number of issues resulting in a lack of popularity. Thanks to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the AI Generated Content (AIGC), it provides a chance to address these issues. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating music therapy from AIGC and closed-loop perspective. In this paper, we summarise some universal music therapy methods and discuss their shortages. Then, we indicate some AIGC techniques, especially the music generation, for their application in music therapy. Moreover, we present a closed-loop music therapy system and introduce its implementation details. Finally, we discuss some challenges in AIGC-based music therapy with proposing further research direction, and we suggest the potential of this system to become a consumer-grade product for treating mental disorders.},

  pages={195-211},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize all aspects of business, particularly new-product development (NPD). Currently, our approach to NPD has remained largely unchanged for decades, yielding stubbornly poor results: only 30% of NP development projects become commercial successes. However, the AI revolution is set to alter this landscape significantly! Leading early adopter firms demonstrate that AI not only finds many applications in NPD but also offers substantial payoffs, such as 50% reductions in development times. This article provides an outline of the diverse and powerful applications of AI in NPD, offering numerous examples from leading companies. Examples include GE's use of digital models and twins to quickly test product designs in turbine development; BASFs use of AI to identify new molecules for use in customer formulations; and AI to generate new-product ideas, identify new-product opportunities, and even create new-product concepts. Our exploratory journey begins at the idea stage and traverses the entire new-product process to the postlaunch period. While AI might still resemble science fiction to many, that future is no longer fiction—it is here now. AI has arrived in full force! With an adoption window of about 13 years, the time is now to embrace AI in NPD in your business. AI will become a major milestone in NPD, perhaps the most important, within the decade.},

  abstract={Fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence are proven business enablers, we have several use cases in the field of technology from basic implementations such as automated scanners, and weak forms such as Alexa and Siri that have paved the way for further development. Search for more avenues of investment in this field continues till date. It’s also evident that researchers and organizations have barely scratched the surface in terms of exploring and using AI (Artificial intelligence) as a technology. Theoretical forms of AI have not yet been implemented. This paper aims to provide some context around the various forms of AI currently used and can be explored in the near future. It’s important to be mindful that, with the use of any technology, even AI, there are challenges, regulations, and security risks that tag along. Firms need to pay close attention to the macro factors that could impact the adoption and AI in their respective businesses. This study aims to provide a brief overview of the aforementioned road blocks that could impact AI adoption, however, there are some solution strategies or approaches that could help firms along the way to overcome those road blocks. These strategies might take time to build and take effect but they will be beneficial in the long run and thus help with not only sustainable implementation, but also complete and successful adoption of AI as a technology enabler.},

  pages={190-197},
  abstract={Social Media Systems such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (i.e., X) are exploding. These systems need proper governance so that the users are safe and post accurate information. This paper focuses on social media governance with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. First, we discuss various aspects of governance of such policies, procedures and risk and then address a key topic which is detecting fake news on social media. In order for the users to be safe using social media we have to ensure that the governance aspects also include fake news detection. Many of the fake news detection techniques utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more recently Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. Therefore, the AI systems that implement the various techniques have to be trustworthy. That means these systems have to be secure as well as ensure fairness, privacy and integrity. Therefore, the paper will also discuss AI Governance as an integral part of Social Media Governance. Finally, to support the various applications and frameworks, both data and the cloud are critical. Large amounts of data are stored and managed by the social media systems as well as used to train the AI models. Furthermore, we need massive amounts of computing power that can be provided by the cloud. Therefore, we will also discuss data and cloud governance that provides the infrastructure for social media and AI governance.},

  abstract={Proper artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) model implementation and training are highly reliant on quality input data. However, the high costs of clinical studies and increasing privacy concerns limit the availability of medical data to researchers. This work explores the potential of applying generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating synthetic medical data based on publicly available real-world datasets. Synthetic data is generated based on real-world observations and used to train several contemporary ML and AI models. These models are subjected to comparison with models trained on real data. Both trained models are evaluated under identical conditions on real-world testing data. These well-known, high-quality datasets are explored in this study covering diabetes and heart disease. While models trained on synthetic data show a slight decrease in objective performance, they still demonstrate viably accurate outcomes. This suggests that the introduced approach presents a potential stepping stone towards improvising data availability for researchers while respecting patients’ best interests and patient privacy.},

  abstract={The rapid development of artificial intelligence has made an increase in the amount of generated content around the globe. Art is the most threatened field due to AI, potentially affecting the market value of an artist's creation. These generated images also affect artists who rely on their work for income as the accessibility of these models diminishes the demand for hiring real artists. As these generative models continue to evolve, it is becoming more difficult to differentiate between authentic art and generated ones. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accurately distinguish between human-made and AI-generated artworks using a convolutional neural network (CNN) known as EfficientNetV2, ResNet50, and VGGNet. Our methodology involves using a dataset comprising images created by both human artists and AI algorithms.

  abstract={Generative adversarial network is a popular deep learning technique for solving artificial intelligence tasks, and it has been widely studied and applied for processing images, voices, texts and so on. Especially, generative adversarial network is adopted in the field of image processing, such as image style transfer, image restoration, image super-resolution and so on. Although generative adversarial networks show remarkable success in image generation, training process is usually unstable and trained models collapse where many of the generated images may contain the same color or texture pattern. In this paper, the network of generator and discriminator are modified, and the residual block is added to the generative adversarial network architecture to learn better image features. To reduce the loss of image feature during training and get more features to stabilize image generation, we use feature matching to minimize feature loss between the real and generated images for stable training. In the experiment, performance improvement can be obtained by adopting our proposed method, which is also better than some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Rapid technological advancements are reshaping pedagogical expertise development, offering novel pathways to equip educators with 21st-century professional competencies. This study proposes an innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-driven professional development approach and investigates its impact on student teachers’ competence development. In total, 28 third-year student teachers participated in tasks to mentor AI learners, applying mentor-acquired knowledge and skills. Task performance and task processes were used to delineate teacher knowledge and teaching practices, respectively, while data from professional development surveys were thoroughly analyzed to gain in-depth insights into teacher perspectives. Findings reveal that AI teaching practice significantly enhanced participants’ knowledge acquisition. Notably, high-performance groups demonstrated complex mentoring patterns emphasizing procedural mentoring. Conversely, the low-performance group preferred a more directive and factual approach, whose behavioral patterns appeared less significant. Furthermore, AI teaching practice also had a positive effect on student teachers’ perspectives toward professional knowledge and AI literacy. The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical and practical understanding of integrating AI-based learning activities into teacher education.},

  abstract={Integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools into software engineering, especially for automated code generation, has started reshaping development practices and raising questions about the future of the profession itself. This paper presents the results of a research exploring the impact of AI on software engineering/development, focusing on aspects of automated code generation and human-AI collaboration. The use of Generative AI tools, in particular AI chatbots ChatGPT, Gemini and Bing (today Copilot), has been tested on use cases of varying levels of difficulty. The results demonstrate outstanding capabilities of the tested tools in streamlining tasks and providing assistance, but show that these tools remain most effective when integrated into a workflow under the supervision of qualified engineers/developers. The paper also presents the results of a survey conducted among software engineers/developers highly proficient in using AI. The survey indicates that most of the respondents believe that AI has a positive impact on the productivity of software engineers/developers, with more than half of respondents believing that AI will not replace software engineers/developers but is a tool that helps them be more productive. Survey respondents particularly emphasized the importance of ethics, privacy, and data security.},
