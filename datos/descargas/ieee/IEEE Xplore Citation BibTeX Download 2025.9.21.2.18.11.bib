  abstract={The utilization of Generative AI (GEN AI) has experienced a substantial increase because of investments and a variety of applications in various sectors. In 2023, the aggregate investment in generative AI exceeded $10 billion. Additionally, AI is a highly prevalent technology in China, with 83% of its companies significantly relying on it. Subsequently, India accounts for 73% of Gen AI usage, while Malaysia's data suggests that this technology is employed in the marketing sector. This investment has resulted in an increased utilization of AI tools in the areas of retail, supply chain management, and customer service. This technology enhances productivity, efficiency, and creativity in a variety of sectors. Nevertheless, it raises a few challenges that necessitate robust governance and regulation. GEN AI prioritizes transparency and accountability; AI systems could perpetuate prejudices and erode trust in the absence of regulations. In the context of contemporary concerns, this paper assesses the regulatory endeavors and issues of Malaysia and India with respect to Generative AI. This paper employs doctrinal research on primary and secondary sources. Malaysia and India have recently disclosed a variety of data breaches and unethical Gen AI practices. Therefore, even though Generative AI is streamlining marketing and assisting in numerous business sectors, the government must re-evaluate its governance, including legal and regulatory mechanisms, to determine whether it complies with international standards and contemplate reforms. The government must also look into balancing the need for innovation and evaluate data protection and privacy concerns.},

  pages={58800-58822},
  abstract={Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) hold immense potential to revolutionize transportation, yet their deployment raises significant concerns regarding safety, security, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis. The proposed framework and simulations provide a practical foundation for integrating RAI principles into AV development, ensuring safer, fairer, and more accountable AI-driven mobility solutions.},

  abstract={Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are two of the most disruptive modern technologies. A blockchain is a distributed ledger capable of storing data in blocks. The data stored on a blockchain is immutable and secured with cryptography. The blockchain can guarantee data security without the involvement of a third party. The integration of it with AI to create distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is increasingly being used in various areas of human activity. AI can increase the efficiency of blockchains by streamlining computations and processes, reducing the burden on miners and decreasing latency. The latter results in faster transactions and reduced carbon footprint of the blockchain technology. Blockchain can help develop explainable AI by means of accessing an immutable record of unstructured medical data and processes used by the system in its decision-making process. The purpose of this narrative review is to analyze the possibilities of using a decentralized AI in medicine.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) facilitates the real-time optical contrast for in vivo biomedical imaging. However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.},

  abstract={The integration of music and video is a pivotal aspect of creating impactful advertisements. This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in generating music tailored for video advertisements through a system we developed, named Ourmuse. By leveraging advanced Generative AI models, Ourmuse aims to enhance the synchronization between music and video content. The methodology involves extracting and analyzing still images and texture context from the video. A critical aspect of our approach is the plot-based training of the AI model by identifying transition points between video scenes, where the video is segmented into distinct parts rather than being treated as a single unit. This segmentation ensures that Ourmuse produces music that is coherent and contextually appropriate for each segment, enhancing the overall impact and cohesion of the final advertisement. By focusing on multi-modal inputs and plot-specific training, this research aims to develop a robust AI model capable of revolutionizing the music composition process for video advertisements.},

  abstract={The launch of ChatGPT in 2022 garnered global attention, marking a significant milestone in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) field. While GAI has been in effect for the past decade, the introduction of ChatGPT sparked a new wave of research and innovation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain. This surge has led to the development and release of numerous cutting-edge tools, such as Bard, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Make-A-Video, Runway ML, and Jukebox, among others. These tools exhibit remarkable capabilities, encompassing tasks ranging from text generation and music composition, image creation, video production, code generation, and even scientific work. They are built upon various state-of-the-art models, including Stable Diffusion, transformer models like GPT-3 (recent GPT-4), variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. This advancement in GAI presents a wealth of exciting opportunities across various sectors, such as business, healthcare, education, entertainment, and media. However, concurrently, it poses unprecedented challenges such as impersonation, job displacement, privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, and misinformation. To addressing these challenges requires a new direction for research to develop solutions and refine existing products. In our endeavor to contribute profound insights to society and advance research on GAI, we present a comprehensive journal which explores the theoretical and mathematical foundations of GAI state-of-the-art models, exploring the diverse spectrum of tasks they can perform, examining the challenges they entail, and discussing the promising prospects for the future of GAI.},

  abstract={With the prevalence of generational artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life, there has been a recent increase in research on individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards generational AI. However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.},

However, several challenges must first be addressed to realize these benefits, as the resource management, network control, network security, spectrum management, and energy usage of satellite networks are more challenging than that of terrestrial networks. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, has been steadily growing as a research field and has shown successful results in diverse applications, including wireless communication. In particular, the application of AI to a wide variety of satellite communication aspects has demonstrated excellent potential, including beam-hopping, anti-jamming, network traffic forecasting, channel modeling, telemetry mining, ionospheric scintillation detecting, interference managing, remote sensing, behavior modeling, space-air-ground integrating, and energy managing. This work thus provides a general overview of AI, its diverse sub-fields, and its state-of-the-art algorithms. Several challenges facing diverse aspects of satellite communication systems are then discussed, and their proposed and potential AI-based solutions are presented. Finally, an outlook of field is drawn, and future steps are suggested.},

  abstract={The integration of gamification in educational settings has shown promise in enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. However, educators often face significant challenges in designing and implementing effective gamification strategies due to lack of expertise, time constraints, and limited resources. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to assist educators in creating engaging gamified learning experiences. The AI-Assisted Gamification Framework aims to simplify the process of designing, implementing, and evaluating gamification solutions across various educational domains, addressing common challenges faced by educators such as lack of expertise and resource constraints. To demonstrate its practical application, the paper presents a case study based on a first-year university business analysis course. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive prompting guide with sample AI prompts for each stage of the gamification design process. The research discusses potential benefits of the framework, including time efficiency, enhanced creativity, and improved scalability, while also addressing challenges such as the need for AI literacy among educators and ethical considerations. This structured methodology empowers educators to create impactful gamification experiences with AI assistance, potentially enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes while overcoming common implementation barriers in educational gamification.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of healthcare, the availability of large and diverse datasets is paramount for the development and validation of advanced algorithms. However, the acquisition of such data is often hindered by privacy concerns, limited patient cohorts, and the inherent variability in medical conditions. This research delves into the potential of Deep Generative Models (DGMs) as a solution for synthetic data generation in healthcare applications. We present a comprehensive study of various DGM architectures, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Normalizing Flows, and their efficacy in generating high-fidelity medical images. Our experiments demonstrate that these models can produce synthetic data that retains the intricate features of real medical images while ensuring patient privacy. Furthermore, when used as augmentation in training diagnostic algorithms, the synthetic data generated by our proposed models showed a significant improvement in the generalization capabilities of these algorithms. This work not only underscores the potential of DGMs in addressing the data scarcity issue in healthcare but also paves the way for their broader application in medical research, training, and diagnostics.},

  abstract={In this paper, an optimization algorithm model based on Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) is proposed. The Wasserstein distance is used instead of the loss function in the generative adversarial network to generate the adversarial network. The model not only has the ability of CGAN algorithm to classify and filter data according to the influencing factors, but also effectively avoids gradient disappearance and pattern collapse. Able to adapt to the data analysis needs of the Demand Response System (DRS) with large data volume and multiple influencing factors.
