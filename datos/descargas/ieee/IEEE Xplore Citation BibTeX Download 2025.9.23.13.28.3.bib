  abstract={This study focuses on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of cultural creation and communication, and proposes an innovative multimodal fusion generative adversarial network algorithm (MM-GAN). The algorithm effectively integrates multimodal cultural data such as text, image, and audio by constructing a cultural feature fusion module, a dynamic adversarial training mechanism, and a semantic consistency constraint module. The experiment uses public cultural data sets and self-built characteristic cultural corpora, covering scenes such as poetry creation, film and television poster design, and music melody generation. In the poetry generation task, the BLEU-4 score of poetry generated by MM-GAN reached 0.45, which is higher than the 0.32 of traditional GAN and other baseline models. In the film and television poster design experiment, the average perceptual similarity between the generated poster and the target style is 0.88, far exceeding the comparison algorithm. In terms of music melody generation, the average harmonic rationality score of the generated melody is 4.2 (out of 5 points). The results show that MM-GAN is significantly superior to traditional algorithms in terms of cultural creation quality, style fit and semantic coherence, and can effectively assist cultural creation and dissemination, providing a new path for the development of this field.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Though useful tools for cyber defense, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) potentially have drawbacks. Threat actors can employ them to do their bidding. The cybersecurity landscape is quickly changing, encompassing AI&#x2010;powered malware, adversarial ML techniques, AI&#x2010;enabled botnets, and intensified insider threats. Cyber threats were growing globally faster than cyber defensive capabilities even before AI arose and was used. Cyberattacks in the past required much manual investigation, labour&#x2010;intensive planning, and patience. Cybercriminals are also taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the ecosystem of the growing networks of connected devices. Cyberattacks will become more sophisticated as result of generative AI, increasing the possibility of ransomware&#x2010;as&#x2010;a&#x2010;service, phishing, malware development, deepfakes, and the exposing of personally identifying information. Another kind of adversarial attack in the context of AI and ML models is AI poisoning. Polymorphic malware leverages polymorphism to evade detection instead of optimizing its effectiveness.</p>},

  abstract={Generative AI (GAI) is one of the significant components that can efficiently improve and augment the AI cycle modelâ€™s robustness when it comes to different threats, weaknesses, and abnormalities detection. When applied in this field, GAI is very useful in emulating the various forms of security violations in actual adversarial settings. These scenarios are important when different aspects of an AI system are tested on how robust they are and thus permit the developers to amend any vulnerability that may be induced before the time it could be utilized in practice. Data and model manipulation, data theft, and adversarial attacks as well as model inference threats which we do a systematic analysis to disrupt the integrity, confidentiality as well as availability of AI models. Considering the current weaknesses and threats related to GAI we provide a systematic approach to how safety concerns that are currently relevant can be integrated with every stage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle management: from continuous monitoring to the application of cybersecurity trends and practices, etc. In our approach, the emphasis is placed on the multi-level security management strategy that incorporates the improvement of coding practices, validation and testing, and the implementation of advanced intrusion detection systems. Before proceeding to further analysis and discussion of the given topic, it is also critical to mention the aspect of regulation and ethical concern as the major drivers of GAI usage. Additionally, organizations can involve GAI in the lifecycle to address security needs, during the development, acquisition, deployment, updating, maintenance, and decommissioning of the AI system, making them reliable, safe, and secure all through their lifecycle. Toward these ends, the goal of this work is to present a set of canonical recommendations for the many scientists, engineers, managers, technologists, and policymakers who will play a key role in constructing a sound and secure AI future.},

  abstract={The research on computer vision mainly aims to enable computers to understand and interpret images. Computer vision is an emerging discipline, and applying generative artificial intelligence technology to image processing is an important entry point in current machine vision research. When generating images, this article utilized adversarial learning mechanisms to optimize the parameters of the generator and discriminator, creating a competitive relationship between the two and gradually improving the quality of the generated images. Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00. The PSNR and SSIM values of the generated image with image number 3 in the experiment were relatively high and close to the corresponding values of the original image. This article provided a reference for the research on the application of generative artificial intelligence in visual effects.},

Another focus area discusses the AI industry's commitment to human rights and social responsibility, examining the diverse actors involved in this commitment and the context-dependent nature of their impact on human rights. This work performs a systematic review and a comparative analysis of the strategies and actions taken by four leading companiesâ€”OpenAI, Meta AI Research, Google AI, and Microsoft AIâ€”with respect to five critical dimensions: bias, privacy, cybersecurity, hate speech, and misinformation. Our study analyzes 192 publicly available documents and reveals that depending on the diversity of products and their nature, some companies excel in the research and development of technologies and methodologies for privacy preservation and bias reduction, offering user-friendly tools for managing personal data, establishing expert groups to research the social impact of their technologies, and possessing significant expertise in tackling hate speech and misinformation. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need for greater linguistic, cultural, and geographic diversity in research lines, tools, and collaborative efforts. From this analysis, we draw a set of actionable best practices aimed at supporting the responsible development of AI models, and foundation models, in particular, that are aligned with human rights principles.},

  abstract={This paper aims to explore the 3D animation generation technology based on AI (Artificial Intelligence) to improve the efficiency and quality of animation production. This paper expounds the extensive application of 3D animation in many fields and the potential and challenges of AI technology in it, and makes clear the importance and practical application value of the research. In terms of methods, this paper designs an algorithm model of 3D animation generation based on AI. Through DL (Deep Learning) framework, feature extraction and sequence learning are carried out on a large number of animation data by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) structures, and the idea of GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) is introduced for confrontation training. The design and implementation of the experiment strictly follow scientific principles, ensuring the controllability and repeatability of the experiment. The experimental results show that the algorithm model in this paper can generate natural, smooth, realistic and delicate 3D animation, and it shows a high level in character movements, expression changes and scene rendering. Compared with other 3D animation production methods, this algorithm model significantly improves the production efficiency.},

  abstract={A table-native AI model that shortens time-to-value for predictive activities on tabular data is being built by SAP. It is called the SAP Foundation Model. The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.},
