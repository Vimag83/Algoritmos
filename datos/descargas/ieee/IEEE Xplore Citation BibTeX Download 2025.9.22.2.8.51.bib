  abstract={This thematic review paper delves into the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of interior architecture design. The integration of AI technologies into interior architecture is reshaping the way spaces are conceived, designed, and utilized, offering creativity and efficiency. Current research revealed that there is still a lack of review papers exploring the patterns and trends in the use of AI in interior architecture. Therefore, this thematic review (TR) aims to discuss the current use of AI applied in interior architecture by synthesizing the literature from 2020 to 2024 using ATLAS.ti 23. A keyword search, followed by a filter using inclusion criteria from SCOPUS and Emerald databases, identified 30 peer-reviewed journal articles which then were clustered into several themes _1) Design aesthetics and methodology, 2) Innovative material design, 3) Eco-Quality design, and 4) Intelligent system design. The results of this study will offer an overview of the need for a new method of designing interior space, and practical strategies for integrating AI in the interior. This review also serves as a valuable resource for interior architects and designers, seeking into the potential of AI in creating intelligent, and user-centered spaces.},

  abstract={With the development of big data technology, traditional audit methods are facing challenges such as huge data volume and increasing complexity. Generative AI provides a new solution for the audit field. To this end, this paper proposes a research plan for audit data analysis and risk identification based on generative AI technology. This study first outlines the application of generative AI in auditing. Then, variational inference is introduced using VAEs to approximate the probability distribution of audit data. In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data. The experimental results show that the generative model performs well in capturing the mean characteristics of the data. The false positive rate of the original generated data is 0.08, and the improved generated data is reduced to 0.04, showing the excellent performance of the improved model in reducing false positives.},

  abstract={For trusted AI, the AI academic community has set up related technical communities, including AcmFacct, Fair & Responsible AI CHI2020, RAI ICLR, etc. However, the sample set adopted by the research in the field of general artificial intelligence technology lacks the coverage of power vision data, which is divorced from the actual power vision scene, and ignores the influence of the evil, diversity and complexity of the outdoor environment of power vision on the model decision credibility, which makes the existing credibility evaluation tools unable to be directly applied to the actual power vision scene. At the same time, there is a lack of critical technical research and support within the industry to accurately measure the model's ability to provide reliable service in real power business scenarios. Through the effective evaluation of the adversarial robustness of the power vision model under three different strategies: white box, grey box and black box, the performance of the power vision model under adversarial attack is verified, and the security and reliability of the power vision model in key power scenario applications are guaranteed, the security risks of the model are reduced, and the reliability of model users on model output decisions is improved. In turn, it can enhance the confidence of users, accumulate more high-quality data in the process of frequent use and sustainable training, and improve the ability of artificial intelligence models, which complement each other, and finally make artificial intelligence technology fully land in the power grid, so that the power grid can enter the intelligent era as soon as possible.},

Adopting the Task-Technology Fit Theory, the research evaluates how AI characteristics (adaptivity, iteration capabilities, learning ability, quality of content) and human traits (self-efficacy, personal innovativeness) influence AI reliance and performance outcomes. A sample survey of 148 middle-level IT employees reveals that AI reliance significantly enhances performance through improved task knowledge validation and higher self-efficacy. While AI’s adaptive and iterative features do not substantially impact reliance, task knowledge validation, and personal innovativeness emerge as crucial factors. The findings highlight the importance of integrating AI effectively into task processes and supporting employee confidence to optimize performance.

We first reviewed the theoretical foundations of multimodality in human learning, encompassing its concept and history, dual coding theory and multimedia theory, VARK multimodality, and multimodal assessment (see Section II-A). After that, we revisited the essential components of AGI, particularly focusing on the multimodal nature of AGI that distinguished it from artificial narrow intelligence. Based on its conversational functionality, multimodal AGI is considered an educational agent already tested in various educational situations (see Section II-B). How significant text, image, audio, and video modalities are for education, the technological backgrounds of AGI for analyzing and generating them, and educational applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for each modality were thoroughly reviewed (Sections III–VI). Finally, we comprehensively investigated the ethics of AGI in education, originating from the ethics of AI and specified in three strands: first, data privacy and ethical integrity, second, explainability, transparency, and fairness, and third, responsibility and decision-making. Practical implementation of ethical AGI frameworks in education was reviewed (see Section VII). This article also discusses the implications for learning theories, derived operational design principles, current research gaps, practical constraints and institutional readiness, and future directions (see Section VIII). This exploration aims to provide an advanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence, which aims to improve students' learning efficiency and interest through adaptive learning paths and content recommendations. The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles. VAE is used to construct a latent space representation of students' learning status and further optimize the personalized recommendation of learning content. To verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper conducted many simulation experiments. By analyzing the learning behavior data of different student groups, the system's performance in personalized recommendation and learning progress adaptation was evaluated. The experimental results show that the personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence has significant advantages in improving students' learning effects, shortening learning time, and increasing learning participation. Specific data show that the recommendation accuracy of the system reaches 92%, the learning efficiency is improved by 15%, and the student satisfaction is 20% higher than the traditional learning model.},
