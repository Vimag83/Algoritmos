  abstract={As a specific category of artificial intelligence (AI), generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) generates new content that resembles what humans create. The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively. Then, we use two exemplary GenAI applications to discuss technical challenges in scaling up their solutions using edge-cloud collaborative systems. Finally, we list design considerations for training and deploying GenAI systems at scale and point out future research directions.},

  abstract={The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is inevitable and significantly impacts our lives. Although AI has many positive benefits, some research results show that it cannot fully replicate the complexity and subjectivity of human intelligence and emotions. The research objective is to assess AI's effectiveness in visualizing product advertisements using Midjourney on social media. The research used a quantitative approach with an online questionnaire as an instrument to collect data from the millennial generation and Gen Z in Bandung City from March to June 2024. The results of the descriptive analysis revealed that Gen Z is quite familiar with AI-based advertising and has good knowledge about artificial intelligence and its use. Consequently, Gen Z can easily understand AI-based product advertising messages, leading to increased brand awareness and recall. Overall, most Gen Z responded positively to the Midjourney application as a valuable tool for designers in developing advertising ideas on social media and expressed interest in viewing other product advertising visualizations using AI technology.},

  year={2023},
  volume={18},
  number={4},
  pages={35-44},
  abstract={Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving, digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users’ requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.},

  abstract={Images are a very useful form of information from medical diagnosis to scientific discovery. There are some areas where images are not enough but with the help of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) this problem is solved at some limit. Due to the success of classical generative adversarial networks, the quantum researcher created quantum version of GAN and also called as quantum generative adversarial network (QGANs) which works on quantum computers which use quantum mechanics techniques such as quantum entanglement, superposition, teleportation and many more. The successful implementation in real life of quantum computers are not easy because of limited quantum resources and access to quantum processors but instead of that there are different QGAN models for different purpose, such as drug discovery, finance, image generation and many more which shown good result as compare to their classical counterparts. This study is reviewed based on authors that proposed different QGAN models along with the techniques proposed on those papers for generating images, which datasets was considered, which parameters are considered, what their limitations and how to future research directions to overcome those problems.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper explores and envisions a collaboration between Facial Expression Recognition (FER) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create an advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) experience. Deep learning techniques are harnessed to interpret human emotions from facial expressions, using a structured approach that includes pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The data acquired from the FER stage informs GenAI systems—such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs)—to produce contextually relevant and emotionally resonant responses. The proposed system leverages a sophisticated camera setup to capture facial data with high accuracy under diverse lighting conditions, ensuring robust and reliable emotion inference. Virtual avatars complete the multimodal experience by generating corresponding nonverbal cues. Special attention is given to creating a dynamic feedback loop for continuous learning and adaptation, leading to increasingly effective human-computer dialogues. Ethical implications, such as user privacy, data security, and bias mitigation, are central to the design and deployment of this system, underscoring the commitment to ethical standards and user empowerment. This paper aims to demonstrate how the convergence of FER and GenAI can revolutionize HCI, paving the way for enhanced empathetic and intelligent computing interfaces.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},

  pages={28064-28077},
  abstract={Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as potent tools for generating high-quality, creative content across various media, including audio, images, videos, and 3-D models. Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.},

While the disruptive effect is especially observable in the information and communication technology field, there is a clear lack of systematic studies focusing on the application and impact of LLMs in cybersecurity holistically. This article presents an exhaustive systematic literature review of 177 articles published in 2018-2024 on the application of LLMs and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a defensive measure in cybersecurity. This article contributes an analytical compendium of the recent research on the application of LLMs in offensive and defensive cybersecurity as well as in research on cyberethics, current legal frameworks, and research regarding the use of LLMs for cybersecurity governance. It also contributes a statistical summary of global research trends in the field. Of the reviewed literature, 68% was published in 2023. Nearly 30% of the articles originate from the USA and 11% from China, with other countries currently having significantly lower contributions to recent research. Most attention in recent research has been given to AI as a defensive measure, accounting for 27% of the reviewed literature. It was observed that LLMs have proven highly effective in phishing attack simulations and in managing cybersecurity administrative aspects, including defending against advanced exploits. Furthermore, LLMs show significant potential in the development of security software, further cementing their role as a powerful tool in cybersecurity innovation.},

  abstract={In the Internet of Things era, the Internet demands extremely high-speed communication and data transformation. To this end, the tactile Internet has been proposed as a medium that provides the sense of touch ability, facilitating data transferability with extra-low latency in various applications ranging from industry, robotics, and healthcare to road traffic, education, and culture. Here, programmable networks are role players in approaching the tactile Internet’s low latency (≈ 1ms) pillar. Several functionalities – including security – are offloaded onto the network core employing programmable in-network pipelines. From the security perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another role player that enables the line-rate inference on the core network without involving the control plane. However, integrating AI-based security solutions in programmable devices is challenging mainly because of their constrained anatomy. Furthermore, such solutions inherit well-known adversarial AI vulnerabilities, representing an additional threat to programmable networks. Considering the above, this article discusses AI-based security solutions in programmable networks, focusing on the explored modalities of integrating AI models in programmable constrained network devices. Moreover, we elaborate on the challenges and risks of relying on AI for such mechanisms. Lastly, the article brings a visionary glimpse for future trends in this regard, raising some essential questions on the indispensability of AI for security functionalities and providing some alternative solutions.},

Rapid growth of AI/ML and their penetration within a plethora of civilian and military applications, while successful, has also opened new challenges and obstacles. With almost no human involvement required for some of the new decision-making AI/ML systems, there is now a pressing need to gain better insights into how these decisions are made. This has given rise to a new field of AI research, explainable AI (XAI). In this article, we present a survey of XAI characteristics and properties.

  abstract={A chatbot is equally vital if its purpose and objective are known. Chatbots are commonly used in marketing, sales, and customer service. Artificial Intelligence has been with us since the first half of the twentieth century. Due to hardware limitations at that time, computers could not execute and store commands. Because of the fast pace of technology, both storing and executing flourished, and so came the birth of artificial intelligence. This study aims to explore how artificial intelligence affects customer relations by discussing different kinds of chatbots. It briefly outlines how integrating chatbots or conversational AI significantly affects how customers behave in the retail business. Incorporating human characteristics into conversational agents drives the design of generative AI chatbots. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Improvements include reducing the chatbot's usage of cliches and enabling users to approach conversations sincerely. Studies indicate that more work has to be done to improve chatbot performance. Circling back to the anthropomorphism theory, trust in chatbots and chatbot overload further significantly impact service evaluation and customer purchase.},

  abstract={Nowadays, IoT devices have a remarkable place in daily life activities. Because of their wide application scope, cyber-attacks have started to increase as causing a critical issue in terms of data security. Because of this, some analyses within IoT network environments should be done for prevention and detection purposes. At this point, it is also important to train users to establish an awareness about cyber threats for IoT and how to analyze network environments in case of unexpected situations. This paper introduces a Web platform, which provides some IoT security scenarios to learn about how to understand / detect cyber threats and test their knowledge. In detail, the platform uses a synthetic dataset of network data pointing malicious or benign network activities. The dataset was generated by Generative Adversarial Networks, which was fed by some original network traffic datasets. Thanks to the synthetic dataset, the platform is able to provide tests or scenarios for randomly chosen network traffic data so that users can learn and test their skills in terms of IoT security. The applications revealed that GAN was successful enough to generate synthetic traffic datasets and the users were positive about their experiences with the developed Web platform.},

  abstract={The integration of more sensory and actuation components to the Smart Grid produces high volume of data. Consequently, this big data stretches the transmission, processing, and storage capabilities of the Smart Grid infrastructures. The vulnerability of advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs) is on the rise, as more devices are connected to the Internet these days. The aforementioned realities have continued to necessitate a debate on the future of cloud-centered artificial intelligence (AI) services for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications. It is rapidly becoming necessary to leverage on the applicability of EdgeAI directly on IoT sensory nodes involved in energy metering. This paper proposes the applicability of Artificial Intelligence situated on smart meter, to perform micro analytics at the edge of AMI networks: Artificial Intelligence of Things. Therefore, a functional AMI model based on IoT and EdgeAI is presented herein. Additionally, an integration architecture for the anticipated Smart Grid based on IoT and EdgeAI is presented. On implementation, the proposed model would provide high performance analytics and Edge computing capabilities to enable AMIs initiate instant data check at the source and relay relevant real-time data to the Utility through the Internet.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has been globally recognized as a necessary skill in the "Artificial Intelligence Era". With the popularization of programming and computational thinking education, how to effectively assess students' computational thinking skills in the context of AI has attracted the attention of researchers. Therefore, this study used a collaborative approach between teachers and AIGC to develop test questions to assess Chinese elementary and middle school students' computational thinking by combining artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and computational thinking skills. The analysis of 125 students in China showed that the computational thinking test developed in this study has good validity and reliability. It was also found that the higher the student's grade level, the higher their computational thinking skills. The study's findings can provide practical references for frontline primary and secondary school IT teachers to conduct computational thinking education.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={326-331},
  abstract={This study addresses the limitations of traditional prescribed meal plans, which lack personalization and often prove monotonous and challenging for patients to follow. We propose a novel approach employing generative artificial intelligence in the context of a learning health system, with an emphasis on inpatient clinical dietetics. The system incorporates two key models: the Meal Plan Generation Model, MeaIGM, and the Meal Plan Image Generation Model, MealImageGM, leveraging state-of-the-art large language models. Patient information from electronic health records and clinical dietetics guidelines are incorporated into prompts for MeaIGM, which is refined through nutritionist validations and users' feedback. On the other hand, MealImageGM generates visual representations of meal plans to enhance patient engagement, utilizing crowd-sourced feedback to optimize image generation prompts. The overall system process includes extracting data from electronic health records, pre-designed user meal generation prompts, and the generation of personalized meal plans and images. Nutritionists play a crucial role in monitoring patient adherence and preferences, contributing to a continuous learning health system cycle. The proposed framework ensures clinically appropriate and personalized meal plans, aligning with dynamic dietary recommendations. The study emphasizes the importance of patient-physician co-creation for constant optimization and highlights the potential positive impact on health outcomes.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has the potential to improve learning outcomes, which has aroused great interest in the field of education. However, few studies have explored the relationship between learning motivation, GAI technology acceptance, and learning outcomes. A total of 313 pre-service teachers were recruited at N Normal University in China. Questionnaire methods were used for data collection. The results of the structural equation show that: (1) GAI technology acceptance significantly predicted the learning outcomes, while the GAI use behavior did not. (2) Intrinsic motivation significantly predicted the GAI technology acceptance, while extrinsic motivation did not. (3) GAI technology acceptance plays a mediating role between the relationship of intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes. Based on the results of this study, some suggestions were put forward to improve the learning outcomes of pre-service teachers using GAI technology.},
