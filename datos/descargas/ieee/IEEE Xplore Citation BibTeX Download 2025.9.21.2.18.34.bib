  abstract={Establishing endogenous intelligence capabilities within telecommunication networks in the form of native artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant topic of research for promoting the prospects of 6th Generation (6G) networks. In the upcoming 6G era, the network is expected to provide services for building and deploying distributed AI applications in the network infrastructure, and such applications will be used solely by the network or offered to operators or third parties as new services. This paper begins by analysing the current status of standardisation in the network AI domain, and next elaborates on the major shortcomings of the current approaches for natively setting up network AI services. On this basis, we present the concept of Native Network Generative AI (NNGAI), which builds on and further advances the concept of native AI for telecom networks. To formulate the paradigm of NNGAI, we first devise the network architecture, and then finally the underlying logical flow of network services to realize NNGAI by carefully inserting generative AI technologies into both the architecture and the service flow of 6G networks.},

  pages={95368-95389},
  abstract={The increasing integration of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) model, into educational environments has sparked substantial ethical concerns. This paper addresses the crucial question of whether to impose restrictions or legislate the usage of Gen-AI, with ChatGPT as a pivotal case study. Through systematic literature review and frequency of occurrence analysis, 10 ethical concerns were selected for further analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis responses of 10 expert panels show that the top concerns, as revealed by their weights, after meeting the consistency requirement, include copyright, legal, and compliance issues (0.1731), privacy and confidentiality (0.1286), academic integrity (0.1206), incorrect reference and citation practices (0.1111), and safety and security concerns (0.1050). Evaluating the impact of these concerns on the policy alternatives (restriction and legislation), the findings revealed that “Restriction” received a higher weight (0.513712) compared to “Legislation” (0.485887). Notably, copyright, legal, and compliance issues, privacy and confidentiality, and academic integrity emerged as crucial factors influencing the decision between restriction and legislation. This study offers valuable insights for educational institutions and policymakers, suggesting the need for inclusive discussions, pilot programs to assess impacts on critical thinking, development of clear guidelines, flexible regulatory frameworks, awareness campaigns, and potential strategies for ethical and responsible use.},

  abstract={The rise of Artificial Intelligence for Science (AI4S) has highlighted the importance and urgency of ensuring open-ness, fairness, impartiality, diversity, and sustainability in scientific systems. Existing scientific systems, referred to as Centralized Science (CeSci), are built on centralized organizational structures and top-down institutional frameworks, which are lagging behind the development and practical requirements of AI4S. To address these limitations, AI4S needs to embrace a new scientific organizational and operational paradigm, namely Decentralized Science (DeSci). It can provide strong support to AI4S via effectively addressing issues such as information silos, biases, unfair distribution, and monopolies and promoting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans disciplinary cooperation in science. Based on these considerations, this paper presents the framework of AI4S based on DeSci and explores its potential application scenarios and research issues. The research can provide effective guidance for the development of scientific systems.},

  abstract={Interest has been growing over the past number of years in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid in cancer diagnosis. However, the requirement for extensive training data to train these AI models presents a significant challenge. This paper proposes a viable solution to this issue by synthesising images to augment the real data in the training dataset. We investigate the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating high-quality tissue images for both colon and prostate. The datasets we use are from the TCGA repository and contain various cancerous diseases for both colon and prostate. We outline how the data was pre-processed, and quality controlled and we also delineate the relevant experiments applied. We apply some of the most recent GAN architectures in ProGAN and StyleGAN to generate synthetic colon tissue images, achieving a literature-high Fréchet Inception Score (FID) score of 6.019 for colon tissue images and an FID score of 3.03 for prostate tissue images. Notably, the synthetic images produced were deemed indistinguishable from real samples when assessed by a practicing consultant histopathologist. By addressing the challenge of limited training data, our approach could ultimately contribute to earlier detection and improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.},

  abstract={The increasing number of international students (IS) enrolled in Australian higher education institutions, combined with the widespread adoption of online and hybrid learning, has significant implications for understanding the factors that influence engagement among this diverse student group. Early identification of students with low engagement facilitates academic success, prevents poor outcomes, optimizes resource allocation, improves teaching strategies, increases motivation, and supports long-term success. This study's main aim is to examine the use of AI to predict student engagement. Development of a theoretically informed survey that aimed to elicit postgraduate students' engagement was developed and validated by expert judgment. In total, 200 copies of the survey were distributed, 121 responses were received, and 96 were considered for this study representing a response rate of 48%. This study promotes a multidimensional approach, utilizing AI and ML methodologies, to determine the influence of social and cultural contexts on student engagement. This approach enables educators and institutions to create effective strategies for enhancing the learning experience of postgraduate students. Multiple AI and ML techniques have been utilized including synthetic data generation methods such GaussianCopula, triplet-based variational autoencoder, generative adversarial networks, CopulaGAN, and conditional tabular generative adversarial network. These techniques are specifically employed to predict various dimensions of engagement, including personal, academic, intellectual, social, and professional engagement. The performance of AI/ML algorithms, including support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, gradient boosting machine, random forest, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and extra trees, was assessed using several metrics including F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, and accuracy. The models used in this study achieved up to 85% accuracy, offering a solid foundation for guidelines and support to enhance decision making processes in higher education. These findings provide valuable insights for both academics and policy makers, laying the groundwork for evidence-based strategies to improve student engagement.},

  abstract={In the contemporary engineering landscape, the complexity and interconnectivity of systems have given rise to the concept of Systems of Systems (SoS), wherein multiple independent systems collaborate to achieve a higher-order functionality not possible by any single component system alone. The engineering of SoS, or System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), presents unique challenges that necessitate novel approaches for design, integration, and management for connecting systems into SoS. Additionally, SoS capabilities can be further leveraged using the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has yet to be fully explored. This paper introduces an innovative framework leveraging AI to address the complex demands of SoSE. The framework itself has been developed using a systematic domain analysis method. The framework incorporates a metamodel, a Matrix Chart for aligning AI technologies with specific SoS capabilities, and a systematic method for their application across different stages of the SoS lifecycle. To validate our framework, we employ a multi-case study methodology, examining diverse SoS examples across industries. These case studies demonstrate the practicality and impact of the presented proposed AI-driven approach in real-world SoSE challenges. The framework is used to depict a useful map to pave the way for further research and innovations.},

  abstract={The generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, renowned for generating human-like text, occasionally produce “hallucinations”—outputs that diverge from human expectations. Current mitigation strategies for these GPT hallucinations largely rely on algorithmic automation, thereby overlooking the complexities of human judgment and cultural influence, particularly in fact interpretation. Addressing this issue, we have introduced a Culturally Sensitive Test that integrates language subjectivity, cultural nuances, and GPT idiosyncrasies. We have applied this test to five GPT models—OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, Google's Bard, Perplexity AI, and TruthGPT—evaluating their responses to 70 questions across seven categories designed to provoke hallucinations. The evaluated models demonstrated varying performance, with controversial topics, those lacking clear scientific consensus and the brain teasers proving more susceptible to GPT hallucinations. Our study has paved the way for a nuanced assessment of GPT hallucinations.},

  abstract={The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and art has revolutionized creative collaboration, pushing the boundaries of traditional artistic practices. This paper investigates the transformative impact of AI on digital art, emphasizing its dual role as both a creative tool and a collaborator. We explore advanced methodologies, including Neural Style Transfer (NST) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to illustrate how thesetechnologies facilitate innovative artistic expressions. Our approach involves collecting a diverse dataset of artistic works, which undergoes augmentation through techniques like Deep Dream. We utilize Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for feature extraction and employ NST to apply various artistic styles to AI-generated images. The results demonstrate that AI not only enhances the creative process but also fosters collaboration between artists and machines, leading to unique and diverse outputs. By addressing ethicalissues and integrating user feedback, this study highlights the potential of AI to reshape the future of art and collaboration, ultimately expanding the horizons of creativity.},

  abstract={The World Health Organization reported 200.8 million laboratory-confirmed illnesses and 4.16 million fatalities from COVID-19 as of August 6, 2021, making it the biggest pandemic since the 1918 flu. The key challenges in COVID-19 mitigation include effective immunization, treatment, and adaptable containment techniques. The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in COVID-19 tracking, diagnostics and prognosis, medication discovery, vaccine development, and therapy of COVID-19 surveillance is the subject of this chapter. AI attempts to emulate the cognitive powers of the human brain, such as problem-solving and learning capacities, using massive data. Machine learning (ML), a subtype of AI, has particular potential in solving issues based on data-curated experiences. Advances in AI approaches have offered a previously unheard-of potential for constructing agile surveillance systems based on a flood of data gathered in a short period of time. Many publications during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of AI techniques in prioritizing, distribution, surveillance, medications, vaccines, and nonpharmaceutical therapies. This review will go over the clinical efficacy of AI-based models as well as the constraints and problems that AI systems face, such as model generalizability, explainability, and trust, which act as pillars for real-world deployment in healthcare.},

  abstract={Soil nutrients have a significant contribution in the health of soil and in productivity of crops. However, traditional methods of analysis of different parameters of soil such as electrical conductivity (EC), pH, organic carbon, moisture content, nitrogen, C/N ratio, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) and soil temperature are time consuming and exhaustive methods. However, with advancement in artificial intelligence, various advanced and digital based techniques can be explored for handling the large number of soil parameters data for better and efficient results. A set of AI techniques including Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) have great potential in advanced technology based agriculture systems. Farmers and soil scientists can identify the amount of nutrients present in agricultural soil by exploiting AI methods particularly ML and DL techniques. These techniques are accurate and adaptable techniques. Accuracy of results can be achieved by ML technique. Generative AI, a subset of AI is playing an important role to enhance the productivity in agriculture domain. In this paper, the authors have shown the application of GAN, a machine learning framework, to generate data that imitates real soil contamination data. This synthetic data can help to augment training datasets for machine learning models.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized higher education with features like instant feedback, resource and material creation, adaptive learning, interactivity, and more. However, GAI also brings with it a number of serious challenges that raise ethical and moral concerns regarding academic integrity. To carry out this transition process, it will be necessary to develop clear guidelines that adhere to integrity standards and ethical codes of higher education institutions. In addition to offering responses to a number of research questions, the purpose of this study is to further the current discourse surrounding the moral guidelines for GAI in higher education. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique and Bibliometric Analysis using VOSviewer, 37 related research studies were reviewed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the number of articles published has been increasing over time, with the largest number of scientific publications occurring in 2024. This can be explained by the fact that, despite the fact that GAI offers benefits and drawbacks for the educational sector, particularly for higher education, it also makes clear how important it is for professionals and organizations to use GAI tools in order to handle ethical issues by continuously developing policies. By creating norms and policies, future ethical problems with GAI in education may be more accurately predicted. The engagement and dedication of academic experts and other relevant stakeholders are essential to achieving this goal of increasing public awareness and effectively utilizing GAI technology.},
