  abstract={As an important artistic creation form and national heritage, painting shows the features of human culture and conveys human thoughts and feelings through beautiful forms of expression, which is a unique form of human understanding of the world. Image generation algorithm is actually the transformation from one image to another, and image synthesis is an important research direction in the field of computer vision. In this paper, the AI (artificial intelligence) art image synthesis algorithm based on generation model is studied. By studying the development of GAN (Generative Adversary Networks), this paper proposes an AI art image synthesis algorithm based on GAN. An hourglass-shaped CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with layer hopping connection is designed, which consists of coding and decoding. By adding corresponding interval convolution layers, the underlying texture information of the image is preserved, and the identity loss is maintained, so that the original image and the generated image are consistent in color. The results show that all three CNN models have high recognition accuracy for data sets, and the recognition accuracy for both data sets is higher than 99%. The algorithm in this paper is superior to other comparison algorithms in RMSE and PSNR. Experimental results show that this method improves the quality of generated images.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the augmented responsibility of human Artificial Intelligence experts in the era of empowered pre-made Artificial Intelligence (AI). The responsible and ethical use of pre-made AI is of paramount importance in this evolving technology. AI systems have the potential to impact numerous aspects of society, ranging from healthcare and finance to education and IoT. The decisions made by AI algorithms can have significant consequences for individuals, communities, and even entire industries. Using a comparison to the way widely available medicines require a prescription from medical doctors, human AI experts assume the role of evaluating, recommending, and overseeing the implementation of AI systems, even when pre-built AI solutions may seem user-friendly on the surface. The paper has explored the expanded responsibilities of human AI experts within two contemporary scenarios involving pre-made AI, encompassing LLMs and ChatGPT. These AI technologies are applied in two principal manners: initially, as standalone AI products readily accessible to a wide audience, and secondly, as elements undergoing exploration for integration into other AI-driven software and Intelligent Information Systems (IIS), with the goal of enhancing natural language processing (NLP) features within user interfaces. In all cases, the expertise of human AI professionals is indispensable, and their role is augmented. These professionals bear an increased responsibility for ensuring the responsible and ethical deployment of AI technologies, with a focus on human-centered design, bias mitigation, validation and accuracy estimation of the results, transparency promotion, and the necessary balance between automation and human oversight. This paper performs a review on pre-made AI and ChatGPT together with custom-based AI and shows that recent advance require an augmented role of human AI experts},

  abstract={Intelligent design has been an emerging important area in the design. Existing works related to intelligent design use objective indicators to measure the quality of AI design by comparing the differences between AI-generated data and real data. However, the level of quality and efficiency of intelligent design compared to human designers remains unclear. We conducted user experiments to compare the design quality and efficiency of advanced design methods with that of junior designers. The conclusion is advanced intelligent design methods are comparable with junior designers on painting. Besides, intelligent design uses only 10% of the time spent by the junior designer in the tasks of layout design, color matching, and video editing.},

  abstract={In the field of computer image vision, with the rise of artificial intelligence and deep learning, the image style migration techniques used are becoming more and more sophisticated. To address the problem that style migration based on traditional techniques has strong limitations and one procedure can only implement a single scene, this paper first discusses the model structures of ANN (artificial neural network) and MLP (multi-layer perceptron), and the loss functions, and then the design and implementation of an artificial intelligence animation stylized system based on ANN and MLP is proposed. Through the test results of the system, it can be verified that the algorithm implementation used in the system corresponds to multiple types of image styles, and the results of migration conversion can also achieve a high degree of agreement with the original image samples, finally A system for converting multiple image styles has been implemented.},

  abstract={The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence into clinical processes requires addressing ethical aspects and inherent risks, contributing not only to the automation of these processes but also to the ongoing development of personalized medicine. The generation of complex diagnostic and personalized treatment solutions must be carried out in accordance with deontological norms and ethical standards, aimed at ensuring the protection of patient autonomy and safety. The development of an architectural framework for the identification of pathologies and the provision of treatment scenarios must ensure both the efficiency of the solutions offered and their compliance with ethical standards, involving the creation of a set of rules and practices that encourage interdisciplinary collaboration between experts in technology, medicine, and law. The fundamental principles that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies into clinical processes promote patient autonomy, decision-making transparency, and clinical responsibility.

  abstract={With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a lot of spheres in life and work have been introduced to a new stage, and English literature cannot be an exception here. It proposes an investigatory research paper that tries to unmask the intersections between AI technologies and literary creativity, delving into how, in fact, such digital novelties are turning the scenery of English literature upside down. This paper will, at first, make an attempt to give some sort of comprehensive overview of the current state of AI technologies. Among the AI tools and algorithms, it is the special attention of somehow making their applications within the realm of literary creation, analysis, and interpretation. The core of these studies plunges into the details of what AI has to do with generating literary content, be it through algorithms writing poems, short stories, and even novels in the style of famous authors or totally from scratch. This study expands the scope of consideration to the collaborative processes between human authors and AI, focusing on synergetic potential for creative exploration and emergence of hybrid authorial identities. In addition, implications of the use of AI in literary analysis were described due to the fact that it is being applied to reveal new critical insights into classic texts using machine-learning models, predicting the future direction of literature, and even critiquing—again using a similar style generator—works of literature with a degree of insight thought previously exclusive to human scholars. Another important focus area will be the pedagogical implications for integrating AI into English literature education.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.},

  pages={402-408},
  abstract={Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in medical imaging has completely changed how early disease screening is done, leading to big gains in accuracy, speed, and patient results. This essay looks at how AI can improve medical images. It focuses on deep learning algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning models that can make complicated diagnosis tasks easier to do automatically. These technologies make it possible to find and study small trends in medical pictures that a person might miss. This helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in cancer, heart, and neurology. AI can find problems in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its performance is on par with or even better than that of expert doctors. The paper also looks at how AI can be used to predict diseases by looking at old image data along with clinical factors. Researchers are looking at techniques like reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to see if they can improve picture quality and help make fake data for rare diseases. This will help make diagnosis tools that are more accurate. The study also shows how AI is becoming more and more important for solving problems like inconsistent data, picture noise, and wrong interpretations. As healthcare continues to go digital, adding AI to medical imaging systems could help with personalized treatment plans, lower the number of mistakes made during diagnosis, and speed up work processes.},

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are advanced AI designed to generate human-like responses by processing natural language inputs. These applications leverage machine learning models to produce outputs that can assist users in a variety of tasks from writing to coding. The integration of Generative AI with CURE had been adopted in a text-based machine learning course during the Fall 2023 semester. A comparative analysis had been conducted on student survey responses from Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 to evaluate the effectiveness of Generative AI in a CURE integrated course. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were conducted to assess differences in student perceptions between the two semesters. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the results indicate a promising trend towards improved student perceptions of both the overall course effectiveness and the benefits of Generative AI in enhancing various aspects of the research process, especially the literature review.},

AI's impact on the field of fine arts focuses on three main areas including machine learning analysis for artwork understanding along with AI-generated art production as well as deep learning approaches for artwork restoration. Experimental studies analyze how AI performs regarding artwork restoration precision as well as artistic coherence maintaining and conservation speed while proving that AI improves upon traditional restoration techniques in terms of precision and scalability. The authentication of AI art creates ethics tests so do biases in databases and issues about cultural preservation. The paper presents the human-AI collaborative model which demonstrates AI functions as a creative enhancement instead of replacing artists. This study delivers a detailed view of AI's changes in artistic practices through research of present-day uses as well as hurdles and upcoming strategies. These findings enhance research about AI and human artistic collaboration by helping both technology development and ethical considerations related to artistic preservation.},

  abstract={The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing (NLP) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, deploying these transformer-based models in resource-constrained environments poses a significant challenge due to their high computational and memory demands. To address this, we introduce in this article generative AI (GenAI) on the Edge, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs deployed on edge devices. Leveraging a distributed testbed of Raspberry Pi 5 devices orchestrated with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s), the dataset captures a broad range of performance metrics essential for assessing the feasibility of local inference in constrained environments. These metrics include detailed measurements of throughput, inference latency, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, along with granular timing data for key stages of the inference pipeline—sample, prefill, and decode phases. We systematically evaluate LLMs of varying sizes under real-world deployment scenarios, with a particular emphasis on CPU-based edge platforms. By conducting multiple runs of conversation-based evaluations, GenAI on the Edge provides actionable insights into the tradeoffs between performance and resource efficiency, enabling better decision-making for LLM deployment in edge environments.

  abstract={The capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolve rapidly and affect almost all sectors of society. AI has been increasingly integrated into criminal and harmful activities, expanding existing vulnerabilities, and introducing new threats. This article reviews the relevant literature, reports, and representative incidents which allows to construct a typology of the malicious use and abuse of systems with AI capabilities. The main objective is to clarify the types of activities and corresponding risks. Our starting point is to identify the vulnerabilities of AI models and outline how malicious actors can abuse them. Subsequently, we explore AI-enabled and AI-enhanced attacks. While we present a comprehensive overview, we do not aim for a conclusive and exhaustive classification. Rather, we provide an overview of the risks of enhanced AI application, that contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the issue. Specifically, we suggest four types of malicious abuse of AI (integrity attacks, unintended AI outcomes, algorithmic trading, membership inference attacks) and four types of malicious use of AI (social engineering, misinformation/fake news, hacking, autonomous weapon systems). Mapping these threats enables advanced reflection of governance strategies, policies, and activities that can be developed or improved to minimize risks and avoid harmful consequences. Enhanced collaboration among governments, industries, and civil society actors is vital to increase preparedness and resilience against malicious use and abuse of AI.},

For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students' grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application. Despite the significant success, we observed several aspects of education where AI alone has not contributed much. We believe such detailed analysis is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.},

  title={Integrating Generative AI with Design Thinking Approach to Improve Efficiency and Relevancy of MSMEs Promotional Content}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={345-351},
  abstract={Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are a strategic sector in the economy that requires continuous innovation in digital marketing strategies. As the need for attractive, professional, and easily accessible promotional content increases, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology is a potential solution to support the efficiency and quality of visual design. This study explores how design thinking and generative AI can be used to create attractive and professional visual content. This study uses a design thinking method with seven stages including understand, observe, define point of view, ideate, prototype, test, and reflect. Each step uses specific tools such as persona profile canvas, feedback capture grids, and retrospective boards, as well as generative AI tools used in prototypes such as Canva AI, Prome AI, Leonardo AI and others to create faster and more optimal designs. The results of the study show that the use of AI in promotional materials significantly improves the efficiency and branding of MSMEs, enabling the production of high-quality content at a lower cost. However, challenges remain, related to the limited scope of the study which only focuses on one sector, namely Muslim fashion MSMEs and the lack of AI's ability to understand the nuances of brand identity in depth. This study contributes to increasing the understanding of the synergy between design thinking and generative AI, as it can provide practical guidance for MSMEs in optimizing digital marketing, and suggests future research that focuses more on assisting MSMEs directly in implementing AI in their businesses.},

  pages={1796-1799},
  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have rapidly risen to prominence in the sphere of deep learning. This is especially true when it comes to image generation, where GANs have displayed impressive capabilities. Over time, as researchers have grappled with the challenges posed by the original GAN model, a plethora of GAN variants have been introduced. These are tailored to counteract training instability, mode collapse, and various other challenges intrinsic to the base GAN model. Despite the extensive variety of GAN techniques available, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding their relative performances on specific datasets. For many practitioners, choosing the right GAN model for a given dataset remains a trial-and-error endeavor. In an attempt to shed light on this matter, our research undertakes a deep dive into three of the most notable GAN techniques: the classic GAN, the one built upon Wasserstein Distance, often abbreviated as W-GAN, and its subsequent evolution, WGAN-GP.},
