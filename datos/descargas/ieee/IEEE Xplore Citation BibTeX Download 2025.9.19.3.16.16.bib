  abstract={This paper explores the innovative application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the revitalization of historical paintings, addressing the challenges of traditional restoration and enhancing preservation techniques. By leveraging advanced AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), style transfer, and inpainting algorithms, this research demonstrates how machine learning can reconstruct, enhance, and restore artworks with remarkable detail and accuracy. Utilizing datasets of historical paintings, AI systems are trained to reproduce textures, restore faded colors, and even repair damaged sections, maintaining the authenticity of original masterpieces. Quantitative analyses, including image quality metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), are conducted to compare AI-restored paintings with manually restored versions. Results indicate that AI-driven methods achieve high fidelity in texture and color restoration, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for cultural preservation. The study concludes with a discussion on the potential applications of AI in museums and digital archives, emphasizing AI’s transformative role in art conservation. Future research could extend these findings by addressing ethical considerations and collaborating closely with art historians to further refine AI’s role in cultural heritage.},

  abstract={A new wave of artificial intelligence applications that offer extensive benefits to our daily lives has been led to by dramatic success in machine learning. The loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability to vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and the general public--all with a range of legal implications. The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies, is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies; and performance evaluation of XAI.},

  title={Research on Clothing Sketch Conversion Based on Generative Adversarial Networks}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.},

  abstract={Social media content is relevant for many applications, including applications that assist in fighting the plague of terrorism through Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.},

  pages={1562-1573},
  abstract={The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

  abstract={Summary <p>GenAI is a groundbreaking subset of AI &#x2013; the cutting edge of the cutting edge &#x2013; that is able to create new content based on patterns and structures it has learned from existing data. Like any AI, GenAI tools are given enormous amounts of data to learn from (what's known as &#x201c;training data&#x201d;). Generative adversarial networks work by pitting two competing algorithms against each other, one tasked with generating data that resembles its training data and the other tasked with trying to tell whether the output is real or generated. Alongside ChatGPT, there are other generative text tools like Google's Bard and Meta's Llama. These tools can be used to write anything from essays and articles, to plays, poems, and novels. GenAI makes it easy to create entirely synthetic data for use in training other AI models.</p>},

  abstract={The development and adoption of AI have brought numerous problems and potential threats, such as information cocoons, algorithmic collusion, algorithmic bias, privacy, law and ethics problems or issues. To combat these issues, governments all over the world, international organizations and giant tech companies all take actions and reach an agreement that AI should be trusted AI. However, there is no uniform definition on trusted artificial intelligence. In the paper, we make a survey on related works on artificial inte llige nce principles and ethical guide lines. The n analyze the ethical foundations of trusted artificial intelligence and give a definition on trusted artificial intelligence. We propose specific requirements of trusted artificial intelligence from a technical perspective and give explanations on these technique requirements. Finally, we recommend some best practices to achieve trusted artificial intelligence and promote the responsible use of AI.},

  abstract={The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.},
