  abstract={It is still a great challenge for the visually impaired people to perceive their surroundings from a global perspective, which makes it difficult for them to interact with unfamiliar environments. The reason is that these conventional assisting devices only address the obstacle avoidance problem. They do not provide visually impaired people with a global perception of the surrounding environment. In this article, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) model is developed to effectively transform the ground images into the tactile signal, which can be displayed by an off-the-shelf vibration device. The algorithm module and the hardware are integrated into a portable device, which provides visually impaired people with effective surrounding perception capability. In addition, a visual-tactile cross-modal data set is constructed to train the proposed deep-learning architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed system can help visually impaired people sense the ground and bring a better traveling experience for them. Note to Practitioners—This article presents a portable device that provides tactile recognition assistance for visually impaired people. Such a technology can be extensively used in tactile mouse and white cane. The developed technology can be extensively used for various industrial applications, such as surrounding monitoring and manipulation. The proposed work demonstrates the promising ability of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications. The generated tactile signals are expected to be used in many human-centered systems, and we believe that our contribution is an important step toward the development of a more comprehensive assisting technology for visually impaired people.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Fundamental to the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is the concept of machine learning. Therefore, knowing how these models work is vital to understanding the mechanisms of how AI tools are built. AI systems are built on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. For machine learning to be effective, it needs the proper training data set. The model is built from machines that use algorithms to learn from the data provided. In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning uses algorithms that find patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Discriminative AI seeks to classify and differentiate data, essentially learning the differences between different categories of data. Training generative AI models often involve unsupervised learning, enabling the model to digest and understand large amounts of text, images, or videos.</p>},

  abstract={With its use increasingly pervading the learning space in higher education, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools are an inevitable resource that can contribute to the digital milieu of Higher Education. Necessitate by an inevitable need to engage with the GenAI tools in teaching and learning, this paper investigates how we may tap on GenAI response to mathematical problems as a potential resource for learning. Instead of solving the problems firsthand, we harness the GenAI tools for their near-instant solutions to mathematical question prompts that included guidance on the steps provided. We then performed an evaluation of the solutions provided. We find that our approach on the use of GenAI tools, along with the post solution evaluation process, has significant potential in contributing to active learning and critical thinking. More studies can be done to ascertain these benefits with research involving student participation.},

  abstract={English writing proficiency undoubtedly stands as a crucial metric in assessing students’ English ability. It not only mirrors their vocabulary accrual and grammatical proficiency but also underscores their logical thinking, cultural awareness, and innovative capabilities. However, the challenge in elevating English writing skills stems from both students’ learning attitudes and habits, as well as teachers’ teaching methods and ideologies. To address these obstacles, generative artificial intelligence has been harnessed to fuel a series of teaching reform initiatives, particularly within the realm of English for specific purposes. In order to cultivate greater enthusiasm and proficiency in writing among students, a quasi-experimental teaching study was conducted for a semester among undergraduate civil engineering students. The research findings have shown that the integration of ERNIE Bot 4.0 in ESP courses significantly enhances students’ English writing proficiency and effectively sparks their enthusiasm for writing.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This study explored the efficacy of using ChatGPT, a generative AI application, in a sophomore-year undergraduate engineering electronics course focusing on students’ learning of fundamental concepts and circuit problem-solving. As a part of this study, a group of sophomore-year engineering students were assigned a set of electronics circuit problems to solve first using traditional methods, followed by repeating the process using ChatGPT. Their experience was captured in a questionnaire-based survey, which attempted to gauge the perceived efficacy of ChatGPT or similar generative AI in electronics circuit problem-solving against the traditional problem-solving method under five criteria: accuracy, efficiency, learning retention, user experience, and assistance in critical thinking, using a 5-scale evaluation method. Additionally, some open-ended questions were included in the study for a qualitative assessment of ChatGPT’s perceived efficacy. The outcome of this exploratory research prompted a critical examination of the application of generative AI and similar assistive tools in the electronics course. Through the qualitative assessment, this study also identified several potential factors contributing to the observed performance differences between traditional and AI-assisted learning and problem-solving. Results from this study highlighted ChatGPT’s inherent strengths in efficiency and speed, while frequently compromising accuracy by being prone to errors and misinformation. Participants also emphasized the human factor of learning and advocated for the active involvement of instructors in training students in the proper and effective use of AI and similar assistive tools. Insights from this study offer a nuanced understanding of the role of generative AI in engineering education, encouraging further research into optimizing the use of technology in the classroom.},

  abstract={This journal aims to investigate the influence of AI-generated art on illustrator’s job opportunities, copyright ownership and creative process. This journal also aims to investigate how the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has allowed the creation of text-to-image artworks, while simultaneously influencing the demand for illustrators, raising concerns about intellectual property rights, and ethical challenges due to the unauthorized use of artists’ works for training AI models. The methodology used for this journal will be conducted using Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The motivation for conducting SLR is to bridge the gap in understanding both the positive and negative implications of AI-generated art on the creative industry as a whole. Using tools like Publish or Perish and Mendeley, 69 relevant studies from 235 collected papers were analyzed using VOSviewer for visualizing key themes. The results show that AI influences job opportunities by streamlining production processes, disrupts copyright ownership through unauthorized data use, and transforms creative processes by enabling new ideation techniques while automating repetitive tasks. These insights highlight the dual-edged nature of AI in the creative industry and the need for ethical and legal frameworks to address its impacts.},

  pages={196-200},
  abstract={This study employs a quasi-experimental design to compare the effects of generative AI-supported teacher comments (experimental group) and traditional teacher comments (control group) on pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns in microteaching. Using lag sequence analysis, the study analyzes reflective behavior patterns based on 66 pre-service teachers' reflective texts on microteaching. The results indicate that generative AI-supported teacher comments significantly optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, particularly in terms of breadth and depth. The experimental group's reflective behaviors covered multiple dimensions, including teaching content (CW), teaching process and methods (PW), classroom atmosphere (AW), and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW), demonstrating comprehensiveness. Additionally, their reflective behaviors formed problem chains, such as "teaching content → teaching process → classroom atmosphere" (CW→PW→AW), reflecting stronger logic and depth. In contrast, the control group's reflective behaviors primarily focused on basic teaching skills (BW) and teaching process and methods (PW), with insufficient attention to classroom atmosphere (AW) and teaching evaluation and feedback (EW). Their reflections were more superficial and limited. Based on these findings, the study proposes recommendations to optimize pre-service teachers' reflective behavior patterns, aiming to enhance their microteaching reflection abilities and, consequently, their teaching competence development.},

  abstract={A zero-day exploit is an online attack using a previously unknown software or hardware weakness before its vulnerabilities can be tackled by its creators. A zero-day exploit could result in unauthorized access, information loss, and extensive financial gains. Recent works have investigated utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks in predicting and detecting zero-day exploits. In the adversarial process, the discriminator and generator refine detection. Studies conducted between 2022 and 2024 have proved the capability of such models in detecting vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, existing GAN based methods are confronted by various challenges, such as high cost, scalability issues, unstable training, and slow responsiveness to newly emerging exploit attacks, rendering real-time detection of threats less efficient. This project proposes an improved GAN architecture tackling such problems through a hybrid approach merging Conditional or Wasserstein GANs and Reinforcement Learning, Vulnerability Intelligence, Graph Neural Networks, and Autoencoders. This stabilizes training, minimizes computation overhead, and maximizes flexibility to new exploit methods. Our model, with this architecture, will be able to provide more precise detection of zero-day exploits, strengthening cybersecurity defenses beyond existing techniques. This method is designed to be adaptive and scalable so that it can provide long-term security against evolving cyber threats.},

  abstract={With the widespread adoption of smartphones over the past decade, mobile applications have become a primary target for malicious attacks, usually in the form of malware. Recent studies have leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for malware detection and classification. However, applying such approaches, particularly deep learning (DL) techniques, to mobile malware detection poses significant challenges. These challenges arise from the difficulty of collecting large quantities of mobile malware samples and the inherent class imbalance in the collected datasets. To tackle these issues and enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) and DL detection models, we propose novel detection models based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, our approach not only employs a conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) for data augmentation to explore the impact of augmentation but also identifies the optimal multiplication factor for achieving the best results. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation approach significantly improves the performance of mobile malware detection models, especially those based on DL. We have notably figured out that doubling the original dataset is sufficient to enhance the performance of ML models, whereas DL models require additional data to achieve optimal results. Hence, our proposed mechanism is an effective solution for improving mobile malware detection.},

  pages={31576-31588},
  abstract={Humans possess the remarkable capacity to comprehend narratives presented in text and subsequently conjure associated mental images through their imagination. This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the generated image and by 130 percent in terms of  $ROUGE_{recall}$ .},

These solutions regularly exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes deeply embedded in the data developers use to train AI models. Perhaps exacerbating the immediacy of the issue, generative AI models can create highly realistic imagery, empowering users with malicious intent. This paper explores the pervasive issue of bias in generative AI and its implications. It also examines how these models, often trained on biased datasets, can unintentionally amplify, replicate, and reinforce harmful biases and stereotypes. Additionally, it delves into the objectification of individuals, particularly women, and in a novel study, discusses how a popular TikTok filter that uses generative AI exhibits gender and racial biases while excessively sexualizing its users. While research on AI bias is forthcoming, existing literature referenced throughout this paper underscores its presence across various systems. This paper demonstrates the continued propagation of AI bias as these systems expand and iterate, often with inadequate mitigation efforts. It advocates for ethical considerations, accountability, and transparency in generative AI design and data selection. The Author proposes a novel framework called the Stereotypes, Objectification, Racism, and Datasets (SORD) Framework. The SORD Framework is proposed as a lens to examine the multifaceted dimensions of bias in generative AI. By critically analyzing these components, this paper aims to shed light on the ethical implications of biased generative AI, stimulate thoughtful discussions regarding responsible AI development, and provoke the lengthy process of removing bias from the systems and training datasets to eliminate AI bias at the source. Furthermore, it calls for collaboration among developers, researchers, and engineers to advance research, mitigate biases, and promote algorithmic fairness using the SORD Framework. Future work includes refining the SORD framework and assessing its effectiveness. Lastly, the Author underscores the pivotal role of engineering education in nurturing ethical AI practices, empowering future engineers to address societal challenges stemming from biased datasets and AI systems.},

  abstract={Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used as a vital tool for describing characteristics of information in the process of data mining and patterns. In data mining, an Anomaly Detection (AD) is an essential part which helps to determine behavior within the data and helps to detect network intrusion. The existing AD in network traffic has identified outliers in unbalanced datasets and difficult to train the model. Therefore, this paper introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based on Minimax Loss Function for detecting anomalies in network traffic. Initially, this paper uses Neural Simulation Language-Knowledge Discovery in Databases (NSL-KDD) dataset which contains attacks and are preprocessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality. After that, these features are processed using the Information Gain (IG) algorithm for eliminating irrelevant features and then anomalies are detected by the proposed GAN-Minimax loss function which effectively identifies outliers, handles imbalanced data and trains the model effectively. The proposed GAN-Minimax resulted in high accuracy as 99.92% when compared with existing K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method.},

  abstract={Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement (SR3) is a state-of-the-art super-resolution algorithm based on diffusion model that can enhance the resolution of images. This method is used to pre-trained models on large datasets and can be used for various tasks without requiring training from scratch. Training SR3 from scratch using the ImageNet dataset involves a complex process that requires substantial computational resources and expertise. The idea is applied the trained SR3 model to new images by feeding the low-resolution inputs and obtaining the high-resolution outputs. It's important to note that training SR3 from scratch is a resource-intensive process that requires powerful GPUs and significant computation time. If you do not have access to such resources, an alternative is to use pre-trained models that are already available and fine-tune them on specific datasets or tasks. The paper shows the result of comparing the resolution of the preprocessed images using a significantly smaller number of images to perform the training with those obtained using the pre-trained model. The results obtained show acceptable results without having to perform on large datasets minimizing the computation time to obtain the resolution of images.},
