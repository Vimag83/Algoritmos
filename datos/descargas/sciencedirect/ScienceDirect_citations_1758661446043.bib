abstract = {Background
Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.}

Although the number of potential benefits specifically related to the use of AI in education is enormous, addressing students' concerns about AI is essential to ensure the effective use of these technologies in education. The correlational survey model was used in this study. Four well-established instruments were employed to collect data from students who studied in different public university faculties in Turkey. Participants were selected from students who had been using AI tools for educational purposes for at least six months. The findings showed that cognitive flexibility, digital competencies and self-regulation skills impact on AI anxiety. Students with high cognitive flexibility had lower AI anxiety, while students with high digital competencies were better able to comprehend and use AI technologies. In addition, students with high self-regulation skills were able to manage their own learning processes more effectively and experienced less anxiety in using AI. As a result, increasing university students' digital competencies and self-regulation skills can be influential in reducing their AI anxiety. Accordingly, educational institutions could offer programs to develop students' digital competencies and AI literacy. These programs can help them adapt to AI technologies more easily and reduce their anxiety about these technologies by teaching students how to use AI technologies effectively and efficiently.}

To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text.}

Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the lack of clarity regarding the mechanisms by which generative AI influences SRL, as well as the difficulties teachers encounter when trying to incorporate it into their classrooms. This systematic review study investigates how to design SRL activities using GenAI. We examined 73 articles published over the past five years, drawn from four databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, ERIC, and Scopus. This study has three major empirical findings. First, six pedagogical affordances from GenAI across the three phases of SRL—forethought, Performance, and self-reflection—are (i) creating personalized learning objectives; (ii) searching for, analyzing, and integrating resources; (iii) monitoring and evaluating progress; (iv) recommending learning strategies; (v) recording progress and providing feedback; and (vi) generating new ideas and examples. Second, popular student learning activities using GenAI in each phase are information searching in the forethought; strategies for problem-solving in the performance, and obtaining feedback and conducting self-assessments in the self-reflection. Third, two major dimensions influencing student engagement in SRL using GenAI are individual and environmental. Finally, we visualize how the three empirical findings relate to each other. Our findings help us understand how AI as a human-machine collaborative tool affects the SRL process. This study provides practical recommendations for facilitating SRL in GenAI-enhanced environments and offers guidance for the design and development of personalized GenAI learning tools.}

Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field. Hence, this review offers clear avenues for future investigation, empowering researchers to expand and refine Generative AI toward achieving a more efficient, resilient, and sustainable construction.}

abstract = {Summary
The mRNA-based therapeutics, notably mRNA vaccines, represent a new era of powerful tools to combat various diseases. However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5' UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5' UTR sequences, and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5' UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by ∼ 200%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for the mRNA 5' UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed at http://www.cuilab.cn/utailor.}

abstract = {Background
Complex prompting and unreadiness among faculty and students are some of the reported challenges when incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into simulation-based education (SBE) in undergraduate healthcare programmes. However, strategies for incorporating GenAI into SBE are unclear. This scoping review identified current evidence on GenAI technology, its role, study outcomes, and strategies to incorporate GenAI into the SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes.
Methods
The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was adopted. Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 21, 2025. Two authors independently screened and extracted data. The PAGER framework collated, critiqued, and reported the results.
Results
Eight studies were included. ChatGPT was the most frequently employed GenAI technology in SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes, to enhance the students’ cognitive and affective learning. Study outcomes focused on usability. Five core strategies were synthesized: (a) establish guidelines on GenAI use; (b) enhance GenAI literacy; (c) enhance competency in GenAI prompting in simulation; (d) ensure pedagogical alignment; and (e) conduct pilot tests.
Conclusions
The findings provide insights into GenAI integration in SBE in undergraduate healthcare programmes. Further studies on the benefits of GenAI when applied to SBE are needed to demonstrate its impact on student learning.}

abstract = {Promoting low-carbon energy systems as a centerpiece of global sustainable development goals is essential. As part of this low-carbon transition, smart energy systems have been an active area of research and education, where artificial intelligence (AI) intersects with energy science. It is an emerging area where research and education face new challenges as new knowledge keeps coming in. During this process, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) plays a critical role in education and research activities. However, GAI's impact on smart energy systems research and education is less discussed. Especially, its impact on education is rarely discussed when compared to research. GAI reshapes both the research process and the roles of teachers and students in the course. This perspective offers insights into the ongoing research and education paradigm shifts observed in the smart energy system. This perspective synthesizes existing studies on "GAI for Science" and "GAI for Education" practices in the field of smart energy systems. In research, the impact of GAI is discussed from both macro and micro levels. In education, this perspective examines how a GAI-driven teaching approach addresses the challenges of teaching smart energy systems compared to the traditional approach. This perspective could benefit the discussion of GAI-reshaped research and education in energy science.}

Despite the growing acknowledgment of its use in entrepreneurial activities, this field lacks a robust theoretical framework and practical implementation. This study seeks to fill this gap by drawing on information behavior literature to explore the effect of GenAI across the entrepreneurial spectrum. By leveraging large language models and prompt engineering patterns, we examined how GenAI could generate accurate, relevant, and inspiring content through various interaction scenarios. Our findings suggest that GenAI significantly mitigates early-stage entrepreneurial information asymmetry and supports sophisticated problem-solving when coupled with appropriate domain knowledge and prompt engineering techniques. However, GenAI’s task complexity limits its use in late-stage entrepreneurial exploitation activities. Finally, this study provides insight into research avenues and practical applications.}
